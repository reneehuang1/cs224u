        "prompt": "Title: Bermuda\n\nBackground: Bermuda's pink sand beaches and clear, cerulean blue ocean waters are popular with tourists. Many of Bermuda's hotels are located along the south shore of the island. In addition to its beaches, there are a number of sightseeing attractions. Historic St George's is a designated World Heritage Site. Scuba divers can explore numerous wrecks and coral reefs in relatively shallow water (typically 30\u201340 ft or 9\u201312 m in depth), with virtually unlimited visibility. Many nearby reefs are readily accessible from shore by snorkellers, especially at Church Bay.\n\nQ: What makes Bermuda a popular tourist destination?\n\nA: pink sand beaches and clear, cerulean blue ocean waters\n\nTitle: Umayyad_Caliphate\n\nBackground: The second major event of the early reign of Abd al-Malik was the construction of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. Although the chronology remains somewhat uncertain, the building seems to have been completed in 692, which means that it was under construction during the conflict with Ibn al-Zubayr. This had led some historians, both medieval and modern, to suggest that the Dome of the Rock was built as a destination for pilgrimage to rival the Kaaba, which was under the control of Ibn al-Zubayr.\n\nQ: Where was the Dome of the Rock built?\n\nA: Jerusalem\n\nTitle: David Gilmour\n\nBackground: working with Barrett had become too difficult; he agreed to leave the band and the others committed to moving on without him. After Barrett's departure, Gilmour sang much of Pink Floyd's lead vocals; Waters and keyboardist Richard Wright also occasionally sang lead. After the successes of \"The Dark Side of the Moon\" and \"Wish You Were Here\", Waters took greater control of the band, writing and singing lead on most of \"Animals\" and \"The Wall\". Wright was fired during the sessions for \"The Wall;\" the relationship between Gilmour and Waters deteriorated during the making of the eponymous film, and during\n\nQ: ['who sang for pink floyd?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Humanism\n\nBackground: Contemporary humanism entails a qualified optimism about the capacity of people, but it does not involve believing that human nature is purely good or that all people can live up to the Humanist ideals without help. If anything, there is recognition that living up to one's potential is hard work and requires the help of others. The ultimate goal is human flourishing; making life better for all humans, and as the most conscious species, also promoting concern for the welfare of other sentient beings and the planet as a whole. The focus is on doing good and living well in the here and now, and leaving the world a better place for those who come after. In 1925, the English mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead cautioned: \"The prophecy of Francis Bacon has now been fulfilled; and man, who at times dreamt of himself as a little lower than the angels, has submitted to become the servant and the minister of nature. It still remains to be seen whether the same actor can play both parts\".\n\nQ: What is contemporary humanism optimistic about?\n\nA: capacity of people\n\nTitle: Sino-Tibetan_relations_during_the_Ming_dynasty\n\nBackground: China Daily, a CCP-controlled news organization since 1981, states in a 2008 article that although there were dynastic changes after Tibet was incorporated into the territory of Yuan dynasty's China in the 13th century, \"Tibet has remained under the jurisdiction of the central government of China.\" It also states that the Ming dynasty \"inherited the right to rule Tibet\" from the Yuan dynasty, and repeats the claims in the Mingshi about the Ming establishing two itinerant high commands over Tibet. China Daily states that the Ming handled Tibet's civil administration, appointed all leading officials of these administrative organs, and punished Tibetans who broke the law. The party-controlled People's Daily, the state-controlled Xinhua News Agency, and the state-controlled national television network China Central Television posted the same article that China Daily had, the only difference being their headlines and some additional text.\n\nQ: When was China Daily started?\n\nA: 1981\n\nTitle: Central nervous system disease\n\nBackground: horses. Epilepsy is an unpredictable, serious, and potentially fatal disorder of the nervous system, thought to be the result of faulty electrical activity in the brain. Epileptic seizures result from abnormal, excessive, or hypersynchronous neuronal activity in the brain. About 50 million people worldwide have epilepsy, and nearly 80% of epilepsy occurs in developing countries. Epilepsy becomes more common as people age. Onset of new cases occurs most frequently in infants and the elderly. Epileptic seizures may occur in recovering patients as a consequence of brain surgery.

        "prompt": "Title: Athanasius_of_Alexandria\n\nBackground: The Arians no longer presented an unbroken front to their orthodox opponents. The Emperor Constantius, who had been the cause of so much trouble, died 4 November, 361 and was succeeded by Julian. The proclamation of the new prince's accession was the signal for a pagan outbreak against the still dominant Arian faction in Alexandria. George, the usurping Bishop, was flung into prison and murdered. An obscure presbyter of the name of Pistus was immediately chosen by the Arians to succeed him, when fresh news arrived that filled the orthodox party with hope. An edict had been put forth by Julian permitting the exiled bishops of the \"Galileans\" to return to their \"towns and provinces\". Athanasius received a summons from his own flock, and he accordingly re-entered his episcopal capitol on 22 February, 362.\n\nQ: In what year did Emperor Constantius die?\n\nA: 361\n\nTitle: Somerset\n\nBackground: The county has several museums; those at Bath include the American Museum in Britain, the Museum of Bath Architecture, the Herschel Museum of Astronomy, the Jane Austen Centre, and the Roman Baths.

Elsewhere, in his poem \"Hierarchie of the Blessed Angels\" (1634), Heywood affectionately notes the nicknames his fellow playwrights had been known by. Of Shakespeare, he writes: Playwright John Webster, in his dedication to \"The White Devil\" (1612), wrote, \"And lastly (without wrong last to be named), the right happy and copious industry of M. Shake-Speare, M. Decker, & M. Heywood, wishing what I write might be read in their light\", here using the abbreviation \"M.\" to denote \"Master\", a form\n\nQ: [\"what is shakespeare's nickname?\"]\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Mosaic\n\nBackground: In the following century Ravenna, the capital of the Western Roman Empire, became the center of late Roman mosaic art (see details in Ravenna section). Milan also served as the capital of the western empire in the 4th century. In the St Aquilinus Chapel of the Basilica of San Lorenzo, mosaics executed in the late 4th and early 5th centuries depict Christ with the Apostles and the Abduction of Elijah; these mosaics are outstanding for their bright colors, naturalism and adherence to the classical canons of order and proportion. The surviving apse mosaic of the Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, which shows Christ enthroned between Saint Gervasius and Saint Protasius and angels before a golden background date back to the 5th and to the 8th century, although it was restored many times later. The baptistery of the basilica, which was demolished in the 15th century, had a vault covered with gold-leaf tesserae, large quantities of which were found when the site was excavated. In the small shrine of San Vittore in ciel d'oro, now a chapel of Sant'Ambrogio, every surface is covered with mosaics from the second half of the 5th century. Saint Victor is depicted in the center of the golden dome, while figures of saints are shown on the walls before a blue background. The low spandrels give space for the symbols of the four Evangelists.\n\nQ: The shrine of San Vittore in ciel d'oro had mosaics from which century?\n\nA: the 5th century\n\nTitle: LaserDisc\n\nBackground: There were also 12 cm (4.7 in) (CD size) \"single\"-style discs produced that were playable on LaserDisc players. These were referred to as CD Video (CD-V) discs, and Video Single Discs (VSD). A CD-V carried up to five minutes of analog LaserDisc-type video content (usually a music video), as well as up to 20 minutes of digital audio CD tracks. The original 1989 release of David Bowie's retrospective Sound + Vision CD box set prominently featured a CD-V video of Ashes to Ashes, and standalone promo CD-Vs featured the video, plus three audio tracks: \"John, I'm Only Dancing\", \"Changes\", and \"The Supermen\".\n\nQ: What were CD size \"single\"-style discs called that were compatible with LaserDisc players?\n\nA: CD Video (CD-V) discs, and Video Single Discs (VSD)\n\nTitle: Grace and Frankie\n\nBackground: and Frankie. Production on season one of \"Grace and Frankie\" began in Los Angeles, California, in early August 2014, and ended in late November. Production on season two of the series began in July 2015, and ended in November the same year. The first season of \"Grace and Frankie\" received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes it has a rating of 50%, based on 32 reviews, with an average rating of 6.2/10. The site's critical consensus reads, \"\"Grace and Frankie\"'s stellar cast adds an undeniable appeal, although its sloppy dialogue and clich\u00e9d sitcom setup will still leave most viewers\n\nQ: ['when did season 4 of grace and frankie start?']\n\nA:",

Democracy and Power in An American City, a very influential book in political science by preeminent Yale professor Robert A. Dahl, which includes an extensive history of the city and thorough description of its politics in the 1950s. New Haven's theocratic history is also mentioned several times by Alexis de Tocqueville in his classic volume on 19th-century American political life, Democracy in America. New Haven was the residence of conservative thinker William F. Buckley, Jr., in 1951, when he wrote his influential God and Man at Yale. William Lee Miller's The Fifteenth Ward and the Great Society (1966) similarly explores the relationship between local politics in New Haven and national political movements, focusing on Lyndon Johnson's Great Society and urban renewal.\n\nQ: What penultimate work by Alexis de Tocqueville makes mention of New Haven's original theocratic government?\n\nA: Democracy in America\n\nTitle: Switzerland\n\nBackground: Straddling the intersection of Germanic and Romance Europe, Switzerland comprises four main linguistic and cultural regions: German, French, Italian and Romansh. Therefore, the Swiss, although predominantly German-speaking, do not form a nation in the sense of a common ethnicity or language; rather, Switzerland's strong sense of identity and community is founded on a common historical background, shared values such as federalism and direct democracy, and Alpine symbolism. Due to its linguistic diversity, Switzerland is known by a variety of native names: Schweiz [\u02c8\u0283va\u026ats] (German);[note 5] Suisse [s\u0265is(\u0259)] (French); Svizzera [\u02c8zvittsera] (Italian); and Svizra [\u02c8\u0292vi\u02d0tsr\u0250] or [\u02c8\u0292vi\u02d0ts\u0281\u02d0\u0250] (Romansh).[note 6]\n\nQ: What do the French Swiss call Switzerland?\n\nA: Suisse\n\nTitle: Craig Bierko\n\nBackground: Tom Cruise throughout the film) and on the Broadway stage as Harold Hill in \"The Music Man,\" or as the lead in \"The Thirteenth Floor\".

If he can\u2019t, the argument goes, then there is something that he cannot do, namely create the stone, and therefore he is not omnipotent. If he can, it continues, then there is also something that he cannot do, namely lift the stone, and therefore he is not omnipotent. Either way, then, God is not omnipotent. A being that is not omnipotent, though, is not God, according to many theological models. Such a God, therefore, does not exist. Several answers to this paradox have been proposed.\n\nQ: What is the Omnipotence paradox?\n\nA: can God create a stone so heavy that he cannot lift it\n\nTitle: Botany\n\nBackground: In 1998 the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group published a phylogeny for flowering plants based on an analysis of DNA sequences from most families of flowering plants. As a result of this work, many questions, such as which families represent the earliest branches of angiosperms, have now been answered. Investigating how plant species are related to each other allows botanists to better understand the process of evolution in plants. Despite the study of model plants and increasing use of DNA evidence, there is ongoing work and discussion among taxonomists about how best to classify plants into various taxa.

Walter Taylor's 18th century mechanisation of the block-making process was a significant step in the Industrial Revolution. From 1904 to 2004, the Thornycroft shipbuilding yard was a major employer in Southampton, building and repairing ships used in the two World Wars.\n\nQ: Between 1904 and 2004, what shipbuilding company employed a large portion of Southampton?\n\nA: Thornycroft\n\nTitle: Glacier\n\nBackground: In glaciated areas where the glacier moves faster than one km per year, glacial earthquakes occur.

In a study using data from January 1993 through October 2005, more events were detected every year since 2002, and twice as many events were recorded in 2005 as there were in any other year.

In 1829 Schwann enrolled at the University of Bonn in the premedical curriculum. He received a bachelor of philosophy in 1831. While at Bonn, Schwann met and worked with physiologist Johannes Peter M\u00fcller.

Chan writes that this was perhaps the calculated strategy of the Yongle Emperor, as exclusive patronage to one Tibetan sect would have given it too much regional power. Sperling finds no textual evidence in either Chinese or Tibetan sources to support this thesis of Petech and Hisashi. Norbu asserts that their thesis is largely based on the list of Ming titles conferred on Tibetan lamas rather than \"comparative analysis of developments in China and Tibet.\" Rossabi states that this theory \"attributes too much influence to the Chinese,\" pointing out that Tibet was already politically divided when the Ming dynasty began. Rossabi also discounts the \"divide-and-rule\" theory on the grounds of the Yongle Emperor's failed attempt to build a strong relationship with the fifth Karmapa\u2014one which he hoped would parallel Kublai Khan's earlier relationship with the Sakya Phagpa lama.

Hume's essay Of the Original Contract argues that governments derived from consent are rarely seen, and civil government is grounded in a ruler's habitual authority and force. It is precisely because of the ruler's authority over-and-against the subject, that the subject tacitly consents; Hume says that the subjects would \"never imagine that their consent made him sovereign\", rather the authority did so. Similarly, Ferguson did not believe citizens built the state, rather polities grew out of social development. In his 1767 An Essay on the History of Civil Society, Ferguson uses the four stages of progress, a theory that was very popular in Scotland at the time, to explain how humans advance from a hunting and gathering society to a commercial and civil society without \"signing\" a social contract.\n\nQ: How many stages of progress did Ferguson theorize?\n\nA: four\n\nTitle: Presidency of Warren G.

Ozone is removed when an oxygen atom and an ozone molecule \"recombine\" to form two oxygen molecules, i.e. O + \u2192 2. In the 1950s, David Bates and Marcel Nicolet presented evidence that various free radicals, in particular hydroxyl (OH) and nitric oxide (NO), could catalyze this recombination reaction, reducing the overall amount of ozone.

Diagnostics using DNA-based tools, such as polymerase chain reaction, are increasingly popular due to their specificity and speed, compared to culture-based methods. These methods also allow the detection and identification of \"viable but nonculturable\" cells that are metabolically active but non-dividing. However, even using these improved methods, the total number of bacterial species is not known and cannot even be estimated with any certainty. Following present classification, there are a little less than 9,300 known species of prokaryotes, which includes bacteria and archaea; but attempts to estimate the true number of bacterial diversity have ranged from 107 to 109 total species \u2013 and even these diverse estimates may be off by many orders of magnitude.\n\nQ: What technique has becoming more popular in classification of bacteria?\n\nA: molecular methods\n\nTitle: Queen_Victoria\n\nBackground: Russell's ministry, though Whig, was not favoured by the Queen.

However, most Slavic languages (including Czech) have been distanced in this way from Russian influences because of widespread public resentment against the former Soviet Union (which occupied Czechoslovakia in 1968).

In 1922, this was renamed the \"British Empire Medal\". It stopped being awarded by the United Kingdom as part of the 1993 reforms to the honours system, but was again awarded beginning in 2012, starting with 293 BEMs awarded for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. In addition, the BEM is awarded by the Cook Islands and by some other Commonwealth nations. In 2004, a report entitled \"A Matter of Honour: Reforming Our Honours System\" by a Commons committee recommended to phase out the Order of the British Empire, as its title was \"now considered to be unacceptable, being thought to embody values that are no longer shared by many of the country\u2019s population\".\n\nQ: How many BEM's were awarded for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee?\n\nA: 293\n\nTitle: Harry Weaver (neuroscience)\n\nBackground: died at his home in San Clemente, California, age 68.

Weaver, acting as the Director of Research at the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, now known as the March of Dimes,from 1946 to 1953, supported Salk's work with a sense of urgency for the development of the Polio vaccine. Weaver's urgency for developing a vaccine as quickly as possible was somewhat counter to the development of the Oral polio vaccine by Albert Sabin between 1954 and 1961.

        "prompt": "Title: Energy\n\nBackground: The total energy of a system can be subdivided and classified in various ways. For example, classical mechanics distinguishes between kinetic energy, which is determined by an object's movement through space, and potential energy, which is a function of the position of an object within a field. It may also be convenient to distinguish gravitational energy, thermal energy, several types of nuclear energy (which utilize potentials from the nuclear force and the weak force), electric energy (from the electric field), and magnetic energy (from the magnetic field), among others. Many of these classifications overlap; for instance, thermal energy usually consists partly of kinetic and partly of potential energy.\n\nQ: What usually consists partly of kinetic and partly of potential energy?\n\nA: thermal energy\n\nTitle: Queen_Victoria\n\nBackground: Eleven days after Orsini's assassination attempt in France, Victoria's eldest daughter married Prince Frederick William of Prussia in London. They had been betrothed since September 1855, when Princess Victoria was 14 years old; the marriage was delayed by the Queen and Prince Albert until the bride was 17. The Queen and Albert hoped that their daughter and son-in-law would be a liberalising influence in the enlarging Prussian state. Victoria felt \"sick at heart\" to see her daughter leave England for Germany; \"It really makes me shudder\", she wrote to Princess Victoria in one of her frequent letters, \"when I look round to all your sweet, happy, unconscious sisters, and think I must give them up too \u2013 one by one.\" Almost exactly a year later, Princess Victoria gave birth to the Queen's first grandchild, Wilhelm, who would become the last German Kaiser.\n\nQ: How old was Princess Victoria when she became engaged to Prince Frederick? \n\nA: 14\n\nTitle: Utah\n\nBackground: of thunderstorms. On average there are fewer than 40 days of thunderstorm activity during the year, although these storms can be briefly intense when they do occur. They are most likely to occur during monsoon season from about mid-July through mid-September, especially in southern and eastern Utah. Dry lightning strikes and the general dry weather often spark wildfires in summer, while intense thunderstorms can lead to flash flooding, especially in the rugged terrain of southern Utah.

        "prompt": "Title: Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States\n\nBackground: In May 2015, a coalition of more than 60 Asian-American organizations filed federal complaints with the Education and Justice Departments against Harvard University. The coalition asked for a civil rights investigation into what they described as Harvard's discriminatory admission practices against Asian-American applicants. The complaint asserts that recent studies indicate that Harvard has engaged in systematic and continuous discrimination against Asian Americans in its \"holistic\" admissions process. Asian-American applicants with near-perfect test scores, top-one-percent grade point averages, academic awards, and leadership positions are allegedly rejected by Harvard because the university uses racial stereotypes, racially differentiated standards, and de facto racial quotas. This federal complaint was dismissed in July 2015 because the Students for Fair Admissions lawsuit makes similar allegations.\n\nQ: Who did the organizations file the complaints with?\n\nA: Education and Justice Departments\n\nTitle: Seattle\n\nBackground: Seattle in this period attracted widespread attention as home to these many companies, but also by hosting the 1990 Goodwill Games and the APEC leaders conference in 1993, as well as through the worldwide popularity of grunge, a sound that had developed in Seattle's independent music scene. Another bid for worldwide attention\u2014hosting the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999\u2014garnered visibility, but not in the way its sponsors desired, as related protest activity and police reactions to those protests overshadowed the conference itself.

        "prompt": "Title: Estonia\n\nBackground: After centuries of Danish, Swedish and German rule the native Estonians started to yearn for independence during the period of national awakening while being governed by the Russian Empire. Established on 24 February 1918, the Republic of Estonia came into existence towards the end of World War I. During World War II, Estonia was then occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940, then Nazi Germany a year later and again in 1944 establishing the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 1988, during the Singing Revolution, the Estonian SSR issued the Estonian Sovereignty Declaration to defy against the illegal Soviet rule. Estonia then restored its independence during the 1991 coup by the Soviets on the night of 20 August 1991.\n\nQ: When did Estonia start hoping for freedom?\n\nA: the period of national awakening\n\nTitle: Emotion\n\nBackground: Phillip Bard contributed to the theory with his work on animals. Bard found that sensory, motor, and physiological information all had to pass through the diencephalon (particularly the thalamus), before being subjected to any further processing. Therefore, Cannon also argued that it was not anatomically possible for sensory events to trigger a physiological response prior to triggering conscious awareness and emotional stimuli had to trigger both physiological and experiential aspects of emotion simultaneously.\n\nQ: Along with sensory and motor information, what information had to pass through the diencephalon before being processed?\n\nA: physiological\n\nTitle: Protocol III\n\nBackground: and their neutral status. At that time, the chosen symbol was a red cross on a white background. Muslim nations have objected to this symbol due to its resemblance to the Christian cross. As early as 1876, the Ottoman Empire introduced the Red Crescent as an alternative, less Christian emblem. Additional emblems have been proposed, including the red lion and sun of Persia, the double emblem (both the red cross and red crescent together) by the Red Cross Society of Eritrea, and the red shield of David by Magen David Adom of Israel.

        "prompt": "Title: Karl_Popper\n\nBackground: In a book called Science Versus Crime, Houck writes that Popper's falsificationism can be questioned logically: it is not clear how Popper would deal with a statement like \"for every metal, there is a temperature at which it will melt.\" The hypothesis cannot be falsified by any possible observation, for there will always be a higher temperature than tested at which the metal may in fact melt, yet it seems to be a valid scientific hypothesis. These examples were pointed out by Carl Gustav Hempel. Hempel came to acknowledge that Logical Positivism's verificationism was untenable, but argued that falsificationism was equally untenable on logical grounds alone. The simplest response to this is that, because Popper describes how theories attain, maintain and lose scientific status, individual consequences of currently accepted scientific theories are scientific in the sense of being part of tentative scientific knowledge, and both of Hempel's examples fall under this category. For instance, atomic theory implies that all metals melt at some temperature.\n\nQ: Who wrote the book Science Versus Crime which challenged the logic of falsificationism?\n\nA: Houck\n\nTitle: Bermuda\n\nBackground: Bermuda's economy is based on offshore insurance and reinsurance, and tourism, the two largest economic sectors. Bermuda had one of the world's highest GDP per capita for most of the 20th century and several years beyond. Recently, its economic status has been affected by the global recession. It has a subtropical climate. Bermuda is the northernmost point of the Bermuda Triangle, a region of sea in which, according to legend, a number of aircraft and surface vessels have disappeared under supposedly unexplained or mysterious circumstances. The island is in the hurricane belt and prone to severe weather. However, it is somewhat protected from the full force of a hurricane by the coral reef that surrounds the island.\n\nQ: Why is the island safe from full hurricane devastation?\n\nA: protected from the full force of a hurricane by the coral reef that surrounds the island.\n\nTitle: Islam in Israel\n\nBackground: Islam in Israel Islam is a major religion in Israel. Muslims, who are mostly Arab citizens of Israel, constitute 17.7% of the Israelis, making them the largest minority group in Israel. Jerusalem is Islam's third holiest city after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia. \"Al-\u1e24aram ash-Shar\u012bf\" (, The Holy Sanctuary, that is originally part of the Jewish Temple Mount of Jerusalem is believed by Muslims to be the location from which Muhammad ascended to the Heavens. This widely accepted Islamic belief raises the religious and spiritual importance to them of the Dome of the Rock and the adjacent al-Aqsa Mosque.\n\nQ: ['what is the major religions practiced in israel?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Communication\n\nBackground: The broad field of animal communication encompasses most of the issues in ethology. Animal communication can be defined as any behavior of one animal that affects the current or future behavior of another animal. The study of animal communication, called zoo semiotics (distinguishable from anthroposemiotics, the study of human communication) has played an important part in the development of ethology, sociobiology, and the study of animal cognition. Animal communication, and indeed the understanding of the animal world in general, is a rapidly growing field, and even in the 21st century so far, a great share of prior understanding related to diverse fields such as personal symbolic name use, animal emotions, animal culture and learning, and even sexual conduct, long thought to be well understood, has been revolutionized. A special field of animal communication has been investigated in more detail such as vibrational communication.\n\nQ: What is the study of animal communication called?\n\nA: zoo semiotics\n\nTitle: Josip_Broz_Tito\n\nBackground: Josip Broz Tito (Cyrillic: \u0408\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043f \u0411\u0440\u043e\u0437 \u0422\u0438\u0442\u043e, pronounced [j\u01d2sip br\u00f4\u02d0z t\u00eeto]; born Josip Broz; 7 May 1892[nb 1] \u2013 4 May 1980) was a Yugoslav revolutionary and statesman, serving in various roles from 1943 until his death in 1980. During World War II he was the leader of the Partisans, often regarded as the most effective resistance movement in occupied Europe. While his presidency has been criticized as authoritarian, and concerns about the repression of political opponents have been raised, Tito was \"seen by most as a benevolent dictator\" due to his economic and diplomatic policies. He was a popular public figure both in Yugoslavia and abroad. Viewed as a unifying symbol, his internal policies maintained the peaceful coexistence of the nations of the Yugoslav federation. He gained further international attention as the chief leader of the Non-Aligned Movement, working with Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and Sukarno of Indonesia.\n\nQ: During World War II what resistance movement did he lead?\n\nA: the Partisans,\n\nTitle: RMS Olympic\n\nBackground: voyage commenced on 14 June 1911 from Southampton, calling at Cherbourg and Queenstown, reaching New York City on 21 June.

An explicit definition consistent with this interpretation was first given in a paper by Bruce A. Wilcox commissioned by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) for the 1982 World National Parks Conference. Wilcox's definition was \"Biological diversity is the variety of life forms...at all levels of biological systems (i.e., molecular, organismic, population, species and ecosystem)...\". The 1992 United Nations Earth Summit defined \"biological diversity\" as \"the variability among living organisms from all sources, including, 'inter alia', terrestrial, marine, and other aquatic ecosystems, and the ecological complexes of which they are part: this includes diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems\". This definition is used in the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity.\n\nQ: Who is the author of the biodiversity research paper?\n\nA: Bruce A. Wilcox\n\nTitle: 2008_Sichuan_earthquake\n\nBackground: Initially, officials were unable to contact the Wolong National Nature Reserve, home to around 280 giant pandas. However, the Foreign Ministry later said that a group of 31 British tourists visiting the Wolong Panda Reserve in the quake-hit area returned safe and uninjured to Chengdu. Nonetheless, the well-being of an even greater number of pandas in the neighbouring panda reserves remained unknown. Five security guards at the reserve were killed by the earthquake. Six pandas escaped after their enclosures were damaged. By May 20, two pandas at the reserve were found to be injured, while the search continued for another two adult pandas that went missing after the quake. By May 28, 2008, one panda was still missing. The missing panda was later found dead under the rubble of an enclosure. Nine-year-old Mao Mao, a mother of five at the breeding center, was discovered on Monday, her body crushed by a wall in her enclosure. Panda keepers and other workers placed her remains in a small wooden crate and buried her outside the breeding centre.\n\nQ: How many pandas live at the Reserve?\n\nA: around 280\n\nTitle: Google\n\nBackground: Google Google LLC is an American multinational technology company that specializes in Internet-related services and products, which include online advertising technologies, search engine, cloud computing, software, and hardware.

Together they own about 14 percent of its shares and control 56 percent of the stockholder voting power through supervoting stock. They incorporated Google as a privately held company on September 4, 1998.

        "prompt": "Title: Universal_Studios\n\nBackground: The production arm of the studio still struggled. While there were to be a few hits like The Killers (1946) and The Naked City (1948), Universal-International's new theatrical films often met with disappointing response at the box office. By the late 1940s, Goetz was out, and the studio returned to low-budget films. The inexpensive Francis (1950), the first film of a series about a talking mule and Ma and Pa Kettle (1949), part of a series, became mainstays of the company. Once again, the films of Abbott and Costello, including Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein (1948), were among the studio's top-grossing productions. But at this point Rank lost interest and sold his shares to the investor Milton Rackmil, whose Decca Records would take full control of Universal in 1952. Besides Abbott and Costello, the studio retained the Walter Lantz cartoon studio, whose product was released with Universal-International's films.\n\nQ: What Abbott and Costello film was released in 1948?\n\nA: Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein\n\nTitle: Franco-Prussian_War\n\nBackground: According to some historians, Bismarck adroitly created a diplomatic crisis over the succession to the Spanish throne, then edited a dispatch about a meeting between King William of Prussia and the French ambassador, to make it appear that the French had been insulted. The French press and parliament demanded a war, which the generals of Napoleon III assured him that France would win. Napoleon and his Prime Minister, \u00c9mile Ollivier, for their parts sought war to solve their problems with political disunity in France. On 16 July 1870, the French parliament voted to declare war on the German Kingdom of Prussia and hostilities began three days later. The German coalition mobilised its troops much more quickly than the French and rapidly invaded northeastern France. The German forces were superior in numbers, had better training and leadership and made more effective use of modern technology, particularly railroads and artillery.\n\nQ: What diplomatic crisis was Bismarck credited with skillfully creating? \n\nA: succession to the Spanish throne\n\nTitle: History of Algeria\n\nBackground: various stages of the conquests. The borders of modern Algeria were created by the French, whose colonization began in 1830 (French invasion began on July 5). To benefit French colonists (many of whom were not in fact of French origin but Italian, Maltese, and Spanish) and nearly the entirety of whom lived in urban areas, northern Algeria was eventually organized into overseas departments of France, with representatives in the French National Assembly. France controlled the entire country, but the traditional Muslim population in the rural areas remained separated from the modern economic infrastructure of the European community.

Design of the bank building is credited to Samuel Blodgett, Superintendent of Buildings for the new capital in Washington, DC., although it has also been attributed to James Hoban. It was completed in 1795. The First Bank of the United States has received various designations\n\nQ: ['when was the first bank of the united states?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Heian_period\n\nBackground: When Emperor Kammu moved the capital to Heian-ky\u014d (Ky\u014dto), which remained the imperial capital for the next 1,000 years, he did so not only to strengthen imperial authority but also to improve his seat of government geopolitically. Nara was abandoned after only 70 years in part due to the ascendancy of D\u014dky\u014d and the encroaching secular power of the Buddhist institutions there. Ky\u014dto had good river access to the sea and could be reached by land routes from the eastern provinces. The early Heian period (784\u2013967) continued Nara culture; the Heian capital was patterned on the Chinese Tang capital at Chang'an, as was Nara, but on a larger scale than Nara. Kammu endeavoured to improve the Tang-style administrative system which was in use. Known as the ritsury\u014d, this system attempted to recreate the Tang imperium in Japan, despite the \"tremendous differences in the levels of development between the two countries\". Despite the decline of the Taika-Taih\u014d reforms, imperial government was vigorous during the early Heian period. Indeed, Kammu's avoidance of drastic reform decreased the intensity of political struggles, and he became recognized as one of Japan's most forceful emperors.\n\nQ: What time period was the early Heian era?\n\nA: 784\u2013967\n\nTitle: Windows_8\n\nBackground: A vertical toolbar known as the charms (accessed by swiping from the right edge of a touchscreen, or pointing the cursor at hotspots in the right corners of a screen) provides access to system and app-related functions, such as search, sharing, device management, settings, and a Start button. The traditional desktop environment for running desktop applications is accessed via a tile on the Start screen. The Start button on the taskbar from previous versions of Windows has been converted into a hotspot in the lower-left corner of the screen, which displays a large tooltip displaying a thumbnail of the Start screen. Swiping from the left edge of a touchscreen or clicking in the top-left corner of the screen allows one to switch between apps and Desktop. Pointing the cursor in the top-left corner of the screen and moving down reveals a thumbnail list of active apps. Aside from the removal of the Start button and the replacement of the Aero Glass theme with a flatter and solid-colored design, the desktop interface on Windows 8 is similar to that of Windows 7.\n\nQ: How is the traditional desktop evironment opened?\n\nA: via a tile on the Start screen\n\nTitle: Cryogenics\n\nBackground: scale, both of which measure from absolute zero, rather than more usual scales such as Celsius or Fahrenheit, with their zeroes at arbitrary temperatures.

A Buddha era is the stretch of history during which people remember and practice the teachings of the earliest known Buddha. This Buddha era will end when all the knowledge, evidence and teachings of Gautama Buddha have vanished. This belief therefore maintains that many Buddha eras have started and ended throughout the course of human existence.[web 15][web 16] The Gautama Buddha, therefore, is the Buddha of this era, who taught directly or indirectly to all other Buddhas in it (see types of Buddhas).\n\nQ: Who is the Buddha of this Buddha era?\n\nA: Gautama Buddha\n\nTitle: Neptune\n\nBackground: Neptune has 14 known moons. Triton is the largest Neptunian moon, comprising more than 99.5% of the mass in orbit around Neptune,[e] and it is the only one massive enough to be spheroidal. Triton was discovered by William Lassell just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself. Unlike all other large planetary moons in the Solar System, Triton has a retrograde orbit, indicating that it was captured rather than forming in place; it was probably once a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt. It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a synchronous rotation, and it is slowly spiralling inward because of tidal acceleration. It will eventually be torn apart, in about 3.6 billion years, when it reaches the Roche limit. In 1989, Triton was the coldest object that had yet been measured in the Solar System, with estimated temperatures of 38 K (\u2212235 \u00b0C).\n\nQ: What does Triton's orbit suggest about it's relation to Neptune?\n\nA: that it was captured\n\nTitle: Champs-E\u0301lyse\u0301es\n\nBackground: runs for 1.91 km (1.18 mi) through the 8th arrondissement in northwestern Paris, from the Place de la Concorde in the east, with the Obelisk of Luxor, to the Place Charles de Gaulle (formerly the \"Place de l'\u00c9toile\") in the west, location of the Arc de Triomphe.

Simon Reynolds described the period as \"a fair match for the sixties in terms of the sheer amount of great music created, the spirit of adventure and idealism that infused it, and the way that the music seemed inextricably connected to the political and social turbulence of its era\". Nicholas Lezard wrote that the music of the period \"was avant-garde, open to any musical possibilities that suggested themselves, united only in the sense that it was very often cerebral, concocted by brainy young men and women interested as much in disturbing the audience, or making them think, as in making a pop song\".\n\nQ: What do comtemporary scholars think that post-punk actually did for music?\n\nA: produced significant innovations and music on its own\n\nTitle: Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network\n\nBackground: chips. However, the standardization process took years while computer network technology moved rapidly. Once the ISDN standard was finally agreed upon and products were available, it was already obsolete. For home use the largest demand for new services was video and voice transfer, but the ISDN basic rate lacks the necessary channel capacity. This led to introduction of B-ISDN, by adding the word broadband. Although the term had a meaning in physics and engineering (similar to wideband), the CCITT defined it as: \"Qualifying a service or system requiring transmission channels capable of supporting rates greater than the primary rate\" referring\n\nQ: ['what does the technical term isdn mean?']\n\nA:",

With the exception of Tottenham, these clubs were all playing in the second tier (the old Second Division) - Tottenham were playing in the Southern League and were only elected to the Football League in 1908, meaning they are the only non-league winners of the FA Cup. Other than Tottenham's victory, only 24 finalists have come from outside English football's top tier, with a record of 7 wins and 17 runners-up: and none at all from the third tier or lower, Southampton (1902) being the last finalist from outside the top two tiers.\n\nQ: How many second tier have made the finals? \n\nA: only 24 finalists have come from outside English football's top tier\n\nTitle: Presbyterianism\n\nBackground: The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has adopted the Book of Confessions, which reflects the inclusion of other Reformed confessions in addition to the Westminster Standards. These other documents include ancient creedal statements (the Nicene Creed, the Apostles' Creed), 16th-century Reformed confessions (the Scots Confession, the Heidelberg Catechism, the Second Helvetic Confession), and 20th century documents (The Theological Declaration of Barmen, Confession of 1967 and A Brief Statement of Faith).\n\nQ: I what year was the The Theological Declaration of Barmen document created?\n\nA: 1967\n\nTitle: Squeezeform\n\nBackground: Squeezeform Squeezeform or die casting is a manufacturing method that combines die casting and forging to create stronger metal alloys for use in construction and defense industries. The resulting metal created from this process is more resistant to wear and heat and has been very expensive to produce. However, because of this new process, the markets for these metals has grown to include agricultural and auto industries. There were several men who have been credited with the creation of squeeze casting. Together, the team of scientists devised a new way to combine extremely high temperatures and 15,000 psi(pounds per square\n\nQ: ['what is die-casting?']\n\nA:",

It was announced that, starting in September 2014, appointments would be made by traveling overseers. In a major organizational overhaul in 1976, the power of the Watch Tower Society president was diminished, with authority for doctrinal and organizational decisions passed to the Governing Body. Since Knorr's death in 1977, the position of president has been occupied by Frederick Franz (1977\u20131992) and Milton Henschel (1992\u20132000), both members of the Governing Body, and since 2000 by Don A. Adams, not a member of the Governing Body.

Cafergot is an abortive headache treatment, which prevents the development of the headache, rather than a treatment for an established headache.

Arthur Rank, hoping to expand his American presence, bought into a four-way merger with Universal, the independent company International Pictures, and producer Kenneth Young. The new combine, United World Pictures, was a failure and was dissolved within one year. Rank and International remained interested in Universal, however, culminating in the studio's reorganization as Universal-International. William Goetz, a founder of International, was made head of production at the renamed Universal-International Pictures Inc., which also served as an import-export subsidiary, and copyright holder for the production arm's films. Goetz, a son-in-law of Louis B. Mayer decided to bring \"prestige\" to the new company.

        "prompt": "Title: Affirmative_action_in_the_United_States\n\nBackground: Title VII was perhaps the most controversial of the entire bill. Many conservatives accused it of advocating a de facto quota system, and claimed unconstitutionality as it attempts to regulate the workplace. Minnesota Senator Hubert Humphrey corrected this notion: \"there is nothing in [Title VII] that will give power to the Commission to require hiring, firing, and promotion to meet a racial 'quota.' [. . .] Title VII is designed to encourage the hiring on basis of ability and qualifications, not race or religion.\" Title VII prohibits discrimination. Humphrey was the silent hero of the bill's passing through Congress. He pledged that the bill required no quotas, just nondiscrimination. Doing so, he convinced many pro-business Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Everett Dirksen (IL) to support Title VII.:78\u201380\n\nQ: What position of importance other than Senator did Everett Dirksen hold?\n\nA: Senate Minority Leader\n\nTitle: Catalan_language\n\nBackground: Catalan shares many traits with its neighboring Romance languages. However, despite being mostly situated in the Iberian Peninsula, Catalan differs more from Iberian Romance (such as Spanish and Portuguese) in terms of vocabulary, pronunciation, and grammar than from Gallo-Romance (Occitan, French, Gallo-Italic languages, etc.). These similarities are most notable with Occitan.\n\nQ: Besides vocabulary and grammar, what other diffinence is there from other similar area languages?\n\nA: pronunciation\n\nTitle: Amylase\n\nBackground: Amylase Amylase () are enzymes that catalyse the hydrolysis of starch into sugars. Amylase is present in the saliva of humans and some other mammals, where it begins the chemical process of digestion. Foods that contain large amounts of starch but little sugar, such as rice and potatoes, may acquire a slightly sweet taste as they are chewed because amylase degrades some of their starch into sugar. The pancreas and salivary gland make amylase (alpha amylase) to hydrolyse dietary starch into disaccharides and trisaccharides which are converted by other enzymes to glucose to supply the body with energy.

        "prompt": "Title: Sexual_orientation\n\nBackground: Often, sexual orientation and sexual orientation identity are not distinguished, which can impact accurately assessing sexual identity and whether or not sexual orientation is able to change; sexual orientation identity can change throughout an individual's life, and may or may not align with biological sex, sexual behavior or actual sexual orientation. While the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health and American Psychiatric Association state that sexual orientation is innate, continuous or fixed throughout their lives for some people, but is fluid or changes over time for others, the American Psychological Association distinguishes between sexual orientation (an innate attraction) and sexual orientation identity (which may change at any point in a person's life).\n\nQ: What can impact accurately assesing sexual identity?\n\nA: sexual orientation and sexual orientation identity are not distinguished\n\nTitle: Pharmaceutical_industry\n\nBackground: The modern pharmaceutical industry traces its roots to two sources. The first of these were local apothecaries that expanded from their traditional role distributing botanical drugs such as morphine and quinine to wholesale manufacture in the mid 1800s. Rational drug discovery from plants started particularly with the isolation of morphine, analgesic and sleep-inducing agent from opium, by the German apothecary assistant Friedrich Sert\u00fcrner, who named the compound after the Greek god of dreams, Morpheus. Multinational corporations including Merck, Hoffman-La Roche, Burroughs-Wellcome (now part of Glaxo Smith Kline), Abbott Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Upjohn (now part of Pfizer) began as local apothecary shops in the mid-1800s. By the late 1880s, German dye manufacturers had perfected the purification of individual organic compounds from coal tar and other mineral sources and had also established rudimentary methods in organic chemical synthesis. The development of synthetic chemical methods allowed scientists to systematically vary the structure of chemical substances, and growth in the emerging science of pharmacology expanded their ability to evaluate the biological effects of these structural changes.\n\nQ: Morphine was named after what Greek god?\n\nA: Morpheus\n\nTitle: Robert Angel\n\nBackground: The Games Gang and Western Publishing. Then in 1994, Hasbro took over publishing after acquiring the games business of Western Publishing. In 2001, Pictionary was sold to Mattel.

Angel developed another game adult board game called ThinkBlot. While the game was not as successful as Pictionary, it was still a hit for 2 years. Angel has also worked as a producer, known for \"Finding Hillywood\" (2013) (aka \"Film Festival: Rwanda\"), the 1997 game show\n\nQ: ['who created the board game pictionary?']\n\nA:",

Communities were established in Germany and England in the 11th and 12th centuries, but Spanish Jews, long settled in Spain under the Muslims, came under Christian rule and increasing pressure to convert to Christianity. Most Jews were confined to the cities, as they were not allowed to own land or be peasants.[U] Besides the Jews, there were other non-Christians on the edges of Europe\u2014pagan Slavs in Eastern Europe and Muslims in Southern Europe.\n\nQ: What religion were Spanish Jews pressured into converting to?\n\nA: Christianity\n\nTitle: Asthma\n\nBackground: Although asthma is a chronic obstructive condition, it is not considered as a part of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as this term refers specifically to combinations of disease that are irreversible such as bronchiectasis, chronic bronchitis, and emphysema. Unlike these diseases, the airway obstruction in asthma is usually reversible; however, if left untreated, the chronic inflammation from asthma can lead the lungs to become irreversibly obstructed due to airway remodeling. In contrast to emphysema, asthma affects the bronchi, not the alveoli.\n\nQ: What part of the airway does emphysema affect?\n\nA: alveoli\n\nTitle: Ton\n\nBackground: could weigh around and occupy some of space. In the United Kingdom the ton is defined as 2,240 avoirdupois pounds (1,016 kg). This is equivalent to 20 hundredweight, a hundredweight being eight stone, and a stone weighing 14 pounds. From 1965 the UK embarked upon a programme of metrication and gradually introduced metric units, including the tonne (metric ton), defined as 1000 kg (2,204 lb). The UK Weights and Measures Act 1985 explicitly excluded from use for trade many units and terms, including the ton and the term \"metric ton\" for \"tonne\".

Such critics generally argue that the phrase misrepresents the textual requirements of the Constitution, while noting that many aspects of church and state were intermingled at the time the Constitution was ratified. These critics argue that the prevalent degree of separation of church and state could not have been intended by the constitutional framers. Some of the intermingling between church and state include religious references in official contexts, and such other founding documents as the United States Declaration of Independence, which references the idea of a \"Creator\" and \"Nature's God\", though these references did not ultimately appear in the Constitution nor do they mention any particular religious view of a \"Creator\" or \"Nature's God.\"\n\nQ: What do the critics argue the phrase misrepresents?\n\nA: the textual requirements of the Constitution\n\nTitle: Arnold_Schwarzenegger\n\nBackground: During his initial campaign for governor, allegations of sexual and personal misconduct were raised against Schwarzenegger, dubbed \"Gropegate\".

In 2011 it was ranked as the wealthiest country in the world in per capita terms (with \"wealth\" being defined to include both financial and non-financial assets), while the 2013 Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report showed that Switzerland was the country with the highest average wealth per adult in 2013. It has the world's nineteenth largest economy by nominal GDP and the thirty-sixth largest by purchasing power parity. It is the twentieth largest exporter, despite its small size. Switzerland has the highest European rating in the Index of Economic Freedom 2010, while also providing large coverage through public services. The nominal per capita GDP is higher than those of the larger Western and Central European economies and Japan. If adjusted for purchasing power parity, Switzerland ranks 8th in the world in terms of GDP per capita, according to the World Bank and IMF (ranked 15th according to the CIA Worldfactbook).\n\nQ: What ranking does Switzerland hold in terms of GDP per capita, adjusting for purchasing power, according to the World Bank?\n\nA: 8th in the world\n\nTitle: Arena_Football_League\n\nBackground: High hopes for the AFL waned when interim commissioner Ed Policy announced his resignation, citing the obsolescence of his position in the reformatted league. Two weeks later, the Los Angeles Avengers announced that they were formally folding the franchise. One month later, the league missed the deadline to formally ratify the new collective bargaining agreement and announced that it was eliminating health insurance for the players. Progress on the return stalled, and no announcements were made regarding the future of the league.\n\nQ: How many weeks after Policy's resignation did the Avengers fold?\n\nA: Two\n\nTitle: Cigarette\n\nBackground: laws exist in many other countries. In Canada, most of the provinces require smokers to be 19 years of age to purchase cigarettes (except for Quebec and the prairie provinces, where the age is 18). However, the minimum age only concerns the purchase of tobacco, not use. Alberta, however, does have a law which prohibits the possession or use of tobacco products by all persons under 18, punishable by a $100 fine. Australia, New Zealand, Poland, and Pakistan have a nationwide ban on the selling of all tobacco products to people under the age of 18.

The Thracians and Agrianes were widely used by Alexander as peltasts and light cavalry, forming about one fifth of his army. The Diadochi also used Thracian mercenaries in their armies and they were also used as colonists. The Odrysians used Greek as the language of administration and of the nobility.

No certification now offered actually requires the applicant to show their ability to test software. No certification is based on a widely accepted body of knowledge. This has led some to declare that the testing field is not ready for certification.

From the perspective of law enforcement officers, it is generally more important to arrive at a description that will readily suggest the general appearance of an individual than to make a scientifically valid categorization by DNA or other such means.

While Bernstein was working on \"Candide\", Sondheim reportedly wrote some of \"West Side Story\"s music; Bernstein's co-lyricist credit disappeared from \"West Side Story\" during its tryout, possibly as a trade-off.

        "prompt": "Title: Raleigh,_North_Carolina\n\nBackground: In the late nineteenth century, two black Congressmen were elected from North Carolina's 2nd district, the last in 1898. George Henry White sought to promote civil rights for blacks and to challenge efforts by white Democrats to reduce black voting by new discriminatory laws. They were unsuccessful. In 1900, the state legislature passed a new constitution, with voter registration rules that disfranchised most blacks and many poor whites. The state succeeded in reducing black voting to zero by 1908. Loss of the ability to vote disqualified black men (and later women) from sitting on juries and serving in any office, local, state or federal. The rising black middle-class in Raleigh and other areas was politically silenced and shut out of local governance, and the Republican Party was no longer competitive. It was not until after federal civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s that the majority of blacks in North Carolina would again be able to vote, sit on juries and serve in local offices.

The area that can be serviced is from longitude 70\u00b0E to 140\u00b0E and from latitude 5\u00b0N to 55\u00b0N.

Moving to Hammondsport, the group then designed and built the Red Wing, framed in bamboo and covered in red silk and powered by a small air-cooled engine. On March 12, 1908, over Keuka Lake, the biplane lifted off on the first public flight in North America.[N 24] [N 25] The innovations that were incorporated into this design included a cockpit enclosure and tail rudder (later variations on the original design would add ailerons as a means of control). One of the AEA's inventions, a practical wingtip form of the aileron, was to become a standard component on all aircraft. [N 26] The White Wing and June Bug were to follow and by the end of 1908, over 150 flights without mishap had been accomplished. However, the AEA had depleted its initial reserves and only a $15,000 grant from Mrs. Bell allowed it to continue with experiments. Lt.

        "prompt": "Title: George_VI\n\nBackground: In February 1918, he was appointed Officer in Charge of Boys at the Royal Naval Air Service's training establishment at Cranwell. With the establishment of the Royal Air Force two months later and the transfer of Cranwell from Navy to Air Force control, he transferred from the Royal Navy to the Royal Air Force. He was appointed Officer Commanding Number 4 Squadron of the Boys' Wing at Cranwell until August 1918, before reporting to the RAF's Cadet School at St Leonards-on-Sea where he completed a fortnight's training and took command of a squadron on the Cadet Wing. He was the first member of the royal family to be certified as a fully qualified pilot. During the closing weeks of the war, he served on the staff of the RAF's Independent Air Force at its headquarters in Nancy, France. Following the disbanding of the Independent Air Force in November 1918, he remained on the Continent for two months as a staff officer with the Royal Air Force until posted back to Britain. He accompanied the Belgian monarch King Albert on his triumphal reentry into Brussels on 22 November. Prince Albert qualified as an RAF pilot on 31 July 1919 and gained a promotion to squadron leader on the following day.\n\nQ: What year did Albert become a RAF pilot?\n\nA: 1919\n\nTitle: Translation\n\nBackground: Generally, the greater the contact and exchange that have existed between two languages, or between those languages and a third one, the greater is the ratio of metaphrase to paraphrase that may be used in translating among them. However, due to shifts in ecological niches of words, a common etymology is sometimes misleading as a guide to current meaning in one or the other language. For example, the English actual should not be confused with the cognate French actuel (\"present\", \"current\"), the Polish aktualny (\"present\", \"current,\" \"topical,\" \"timely,\" \"feasible\"), the Swedish aktuell (\"topical\", \"presently of importance\"), the Russian \u0430\u043a\u0442\u0443\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 (\"urgent\", \"topical\") or the Dutch actueel.\n\nQ: To indicate something is feasible in Polish, what word could be used?\n\nA: aktualny\n\nTitle: Babe Ruth\n\nBackground: Babe Ruth George Herman \"Babe\" Ruth Jr. (February 6, 1895 \u2013 August 16, 1948) was an American professional baseball player whose career in Major League Baseball (MLB) spanned 22 seasons, from 1914 through 1935. Nicknamed \"The Bambino\" and \"The Sultan of Swat\", he began his MLB career as a stellar left-handed pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, but achieved his greatest fame as a slugging outfielder for the New York Yankees. Ruth established many MLB batting (and some pitching) records, including career home runs (714), runs batted in (RBIs) (2,213), bases on balls (2,062), slugging percentage (.690), and on-base plus\n\nQ: ['when was babe ruth born?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Houston\n\nBackground: One wave of the population boom ended abruptly in the mid-1980s, as oil prices fell precipitously. The space industry also suffered in 1986 after the Space Shuttle Challenger disintegrated shortly after launch. There was a cutback in some activities for a period. In the late 1980s, the city's economy suffered from the nationwide recession. After the early 1990s recession, Houston made efforts to diversify its economy by focusing on aerospace and health care/biotechnology, and reduced its dependence on the petroleum industry.

In about the middle of the 19th century \"Near East\" came into use to describe that part of the east closest to Europe. The term \"Far East\" appeared contemporaneously meaning Japan, China, Korea, Indonesia and Viet Nam; in short, the East Indies. \"Near East\" applied to what had been mainly known as the Levant, which was in the jurisdiction of the Ottoman Porte, or government. Those who used the term had little choice about its meaning. They could not set foot on most of the shores of the southern and central Mediterranean from the Gulf of Sidra to Albania without permits from the Ottoman Empire.\n\nQ: What was the jurisdiction of the Levant in? \n\nA: the Ottoman Porte\n\nTitle: Airline\n\nBackground: Europe, 46.2bn in North America, 12.2bn in Middle East, 12.0bn in Latin America and 5.4bn in Africa.

Delta Air Lines is the largest by assets value and market capitalization. Lufthansa Group is the largest by number of employees, FedEx Express by freight tonne-kilometers, Ryanair by number of international passengers carried and Turkish Airlines by number of countries served.

        "prompt": "Title: Friedrich_Hayek\n\nBackground: Asked about the liberal, non-democratic rule by a Chilean interviewer, Hayek is translated from German to Spanish to English as having said, \"As long term institutions, I am totally against dictatorships. But a dictatorship may be a necessary system for a transitional period. [...] Personally I prefer a liberal dictatorship to democratic government devoid of liberalism. My personal impression \u2013 and this is valid for South America \u2013 is that in Chile, for example, we will witness a transition from a dictatorial government to a liberal government.\" In a letter to the London Times, he defended the Pinochet regime and said that he had \"not been able to find a single person even in much maligned Chile who did not agree that personal freedom was much greater under Pinochet than it had been under Allende.\" Hayek admitted that \"it is not very likely that this will succeed, even if, at a particular point in time, it may be the only hope there is.\", he explained, however, \"It is not certain hope, because it will always depend on the goodwill of an individual, and there are very few individuals one can trust. But if it is the sole opportunity which exists at a particular moment it may be the best solution despite this. And only if and when the dictatorial government is visibly directing its steps towards limited democracy\".\n\nQ: At what point did Hayek claim dictatorships may be necessary?\n\nA: a transitional period\n\nTitle: Uranium\n\nBackground: Most ingested uranium is excreted during digestion. Only 0.5% is absorbed when insoluble forms of uranium, such as its oxide, are ingested, whereas absorption of the more soluble uranyl ion can be up to 5%. However, soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through the body, whereas insoluble uranium compounds, especially when inhaled by way of dust into the lungs, pose a more serious exposure hazard. After entering the bloodstream, the absorbed uranium tends to bioaccumulate and stay for many years in bone tissue because of uranium's affinity for phosphates. Uranium is not absorbed through the skin, and alpha particles released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin.\n\nQ: About what percentage of uranium oxide is absorbed when ingested?\n\nA: 0.5%\n\nTitle: Cricket World Cup hosts\n\nBackground: hosted the first three competitions. The ICC decided that England should host the first tournament because it was ready to put the resources needed in organising the inaugural event.

This meant that a match could be completed in one day. 1975, 1979 & 1983 Host: The first competition hosted outside England was the 1987 Cricket World Cup, which was jointly held in India and Pakistan.

In practice, these are no longer the most accurate methods. The CODATA value quoted here is based on three watt-balance measurements of KJ2RK and one inter-laboratory determination of the molar volume of silicon, but is mostly determined by a 2007 watt-balance measurement made at the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). Five other measurements by three different methods were initially considered, but not included in the final refinement as they were too imprecise to affect the result.\n\nQ: The value quoted here for the Planck constant is based on a measurement in what year?\n\nA: 2007\n\nTitle: Seven_Years%27_War\n\nBackground: The year 1759 saw several Prussian defeats. At the Battle of Kay, or Paltzig, the Russian Count Saltykov with 47,000 Russians defeated 26,000 Prussians commanded by General Carl Heinrich von Wedel. Though the Hanoverians defeated an army of 60,000 French at Minden, Austrian general Daun forced the surrender of an entire Prussian corps of 13,000 in the Battle of Maxen. Frederick himself lost half his army in the Battle of Kunersdorf (now Kunowice Poland), the worst defeat in his military career and one that drove him to the brink of abdication and thoughts of suicide. The disaster resulted partly from his misjudgment of the Russians, who had already demonstrated their strength at Zorndorf and at Gross-J\u00e4gersdorf (now Motornoye, Russia), and partly from good cooperation between the Russian and Austrian forces.\n\nQ: How did the Prussian army perform in 1759/\n\nA: 1759 saw several Prussian defeats\n\nTitle: Great Pyramid of Giza\n\nBackground: the pyramid for nobles.

Khufu's vizier, Hemiunu (also called Hemon) is believed by some to be the architect of the Great Pyramid. It is thought that, at construction, the Great Pyramid was originally 280 Egyptian Royal cubits tall (), but with erosion and absence of its pyramidion, its present height is .

        "prompt": "Title: Egypt\n\nBackground: Egypt has one of the longest histories of any modern country, arising in the tenth millennium BC as one of the world's first nation states. Considered a cradle of civilisation, Ancient Egypt experienced some of the earliest developments of writing, agriculture, urbanisation, organised religion and central government. Iconic monuments such as the Giza Necropolis and its Great Sphinx, as well the ruins of Memphis, Thebes, Karnak, and the Valley of the Kings, reflect this legacy and remain a significant focus of archaeological study and popular interest worldwide. Egypt's rich cultural heritage is an integral part of its national identity, having endured, and at times assimilated, various foreign influences, including Greek, Persian, Roman, Arab, Ottoman, and European. Although Christianised in the first century of the Common Era, it was subsequently Islamised due to the Islamic conquests of the seventh century.\n\nQ: How far back does Egypt's history date back?\n\nA: tenth millennium BC\n\nTitle: Steven_Spielberg\n\nBackground: While still a student, he was offered a small unpaid intern job at Universal Studios with the editing department. He was later given the opportunity to make a short film for theatrical release, the 26-minute, 35mm, Amblin', which he wrote and directed. Studio vice president Sidney Sheinberg was impressed by the film, which had won a number of awards, and offered Spielberg a seven-year directing contract. It made him the youngest director ever to be signed for a long-term deal with a major Hollywood studio.:548 He subsequently dropped out of college to begin professionally directing TV productions with Universal.\n\nQ: What job was SPielberg offered when he was a student?\n\nA: Universal Studios\n\nTitle: Isotopically pure diamond\n\nBackground: Isotopically pure diamond An isotopical pure diamond is a type of diamond that is composed entirely of one isotope of carbon. Isotopically pure diamonds have been manufactured from either the more common carbon isotope with mass number 12 (abbreviated as C) or the less common C isotope. Compared to natural diamonds that are composed of a mixture of C and C isotopes, isotopically pure diamonds possess improved characteristics such as increased thermal conductivity. Thermal conductivity of diamonds is at a minimum when C and C are in a ratio of 1:1 and reaches a maximum when the composition is 100%\n\nQ: ['what precious stone is a form of pure carbon?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Hanover\n\nBackground: Various industrial businesses are located in Hannover. The Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles Transporter (VWN) factory at Hannover-St\u00f6cken is the biggest employer in the region and operates a huge plant at the northern edge of town adjoining the Mittellandkanal and Motorway A2. Jointly with a factory of German tire and automobile parts manufacturer Continental AG, they have a coal-burning power plant. Continental AG, founded in Hanover in 1871, is one of the city's major companies, as is Sennheiser. Since 2008 a take-over is in progress: the Schaeffler Group from Herzogenaurach (Bavaria) holds the majority of the stock but were required due to the financial crisis to deposit the options as securities at banks. TUI AG has its HQ in Hanover. Hanover is home to many insurance companies, many of which operate only in Germany. One major global reinsurance company is Hannover Re, whose headquarters are east of the city centre.\n\nQ: Which company was founded in Hanover in 1871?\n\nA: Continental AG\n\nTitle: Russian_language\n\nBackground: Because of many technical restrictions in computing and also because of the unavailability of Cyrillic keyboards abroad, Russian is often transliterated using the Latin alphabet. For example, \u043c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0437 ('frost') is transliterated moroz, and \u043c\u044b\u0448\u044c ('mouse'), mysh or my\u0161'. Once commonly used by the majority of those living outside Russia, transliteration is being used less frequently by Russian-speaking typists in favor of the extension of Unicode character encoding, which fully incorporates the Russian alphabet. Free programs leveraging this Unicode extension are available which allow users to type Russian characters, even on Western 'QWERTY' keyboards.\n\nQ: What does 'mysh' mean?\n\nA: mouse\n\nTitle: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\n\nBackground: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is a 1964 children's novel by British author Roald Dahl.

There are 56 Zagat-rated restaurants in New Haven, the most in Connecticut and the third most in New England (after Boston and Cambridge). More than 120 restaurants are located within two blocks of the New Haven Green. The city is home to an eclectic mix of ethnic restaurants and small markets specializing in various foreign foods.

Among the casualties of this raid was the Swedish archbishop Johannes. The city remained occupied for some time, contributing to its decline as a center of commerce in the 13th century and the rise of Uppsala, Visby, Kalmar and Stockholm. The Livonian Chronicle describes the Oeselians as using two kinds of ships, the piratica and the liburna. The former was a warship, the latter mainly a merchant ship. A piratica could carry approximately 30 men and had a high prow shaped like a dragon or a snakehead and a rectangular sail. Viking-age treasures from Estonia mostly contain silver coins and bars. Saaremaa has the richest finds of Viking treasures after Gotland in Sweden. This strongly suggests that Estonia was an important transit country during the Viking era.\n\nQ: What type of ship was the liburna?\n\nA: merchant ship\n\nTitle: Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid\n\nBackground: Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, also known as co-amoxiclav, is an antibiotic useful for the treatment of a number of bacterial infections. It is a combination consisting of amoxicillin, a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic, and potassium clavulanate, a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor. It is specifically used for otitis media, strep throat, pneumonia, cellulitis, urinary tract infections, animal bites, and tuberculosis. It is taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. Common side effects include diarrhea, vomiting, and allergic reactions. It also increases the risk of yeast infections, headaches, and blood clotting problems.

In 1855, Washington Territorial Governor Isaac Stevens negotiated the Hellgate treaty between the United States Government and the Salish, Pend d'Oreille, and the Kootenai people of western Montana, which established boundaries for the tribal nations. The treaty was ratified in 1859. While the treaty established what later became the Flathead Indian Reservation, trouble with interpreters and confusion over the terms of the treaty led whites to believe that the Bitterroot Valley was opened to settlement, but the tribal nations disputed those provisions. The Salish remained in the Bitterroot Valley until 1891.\n\nQ: What year was the treaty ratified?\n\nA: 1859\n\nTitle: Demographic history of Poland\n\nBackground: USSR.

However, legislation by the United Kingdom parliament allowing patronage led to splits in the Church. In 1733, a group of ministers seceded from the Church of Scotland to form the Associate Presbytery, another group seceded in 1761 to form the Relief Church and the Disruption of 1843 led to the formation of the Free Church of Scotland.

        "prompt": "Title: Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States\n\nBackground: In 1976, contemporaneously with Woodson and Roberts, the Court decided Gregg v. Georgia and upheld a procedure in which the trial of capital crimes was bifurcated into guilt-innocence and sentencing phases. At the first proceeding, the jury decides the defendant's guilt; if the defendant is innocent or otherwise not convicted of first-degree murder, the death penalty will not be imposed. At the second hearing, the jury determines whether certain statutory aggravating factors exist, whether any mitigating factors exist, and, in many jurisdictions, weigh the aggravating and mitigating factors in assessing the ultimate penalty \u2013 either death or life in prison, either with or without parole.\n\nQ: What is decided at the first proceeding?\n\nA: the defendant's guilt\n\nTitle: American_Idol\n\nBackground: Season ten of the series premiered on January 19, 2011. Many changes were introduced this season, from the format to the personnel of the show. Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler joined Randy Jackson as judges following the departures of Simon Cowell (who left to launch the U.S. version of The X Factor), Kara DioGuardi (whose contract was not renewed) and Ellen DeGeneres, while Nigel Lythgoe returned as executive producer. Jimmy Iovine, chairman of the Interscope Geffen A&M label group, the new partner of American Idol, acted as the in-house mentor in place of weekly guest mentors, although in later episodes special guest mentors such as Beyonc\u00e9, will.i.am and Lady Gaga were brought in.\n\nQ: Who was the in-house mentor this season?\n\nA: Jimmy Iovine\n\nTitle: Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)\n\nBackground: the offer. On May 19, 2009, it was announced that the fourth season would be the last prime time season of the show. The syndicated show continued for one additional season before it ended its run in 2010. On March 13, 2018, CNBC announced production would resume on \"Deal or No Deal\" for another season. Mandel returned as host and serves as co-executive producer along with Scott St. John, who served in the role for the original series.

        "prompt": "Title: Ashkenazi_Jews\n\nBackground: In the Yoma tractate of the Babylonian Talmud the name Gomer is rendered as Germania, which elsewhere in rabbinical literature was identified with Germanikia in northwestern Syria, but later became associated with Germania. Ashkenaz is linked to Scandza/Scanzia, viewed as the cradle of Germanic tribes, as early as a 6th-century gloss to the Historia Ecclesiastica of Eusebius. In the 10th-century History of Armenia of Yovhannes Drasxanakertc'i (1.15) Ashkenaz was associated with Armenia, as it was occasionally in Jewish usage, where its denotation extended at times to Adiabene, Khazaria, Crimea and areas to the east. His contemporary Saadia Gaon identified Ashkenaz with the Saquliba or Slavic territories, and such usage covered also the lands of tribes neighboring the Slavs, and Eastern and Central Europe. In modern times, Samuel Krauss identified the Biblical \"Ashkenaz\" with Khazaria.\n\nQ: Ashkenaz is linked to Scandza/Scanzia, which is viewed as what?\n\nA: cradle of Germanic tribes\n\nTitle: Anti-aircraft_warfare\n\nBackground: Unlike the heavier guns, these smaller weapons are in widespread use due to their low cost and ability to quickly follow the target. Classic examples of autocannons and large caliber guns are the 40 mm autocannon and the 8.8 cm FlaK 18, 36 gun, both designed by Bofors of Sweden. Artillery weapons of this sort have for the most part been superseded by the effective surface-to-air missile systems that were introduced in the 1950s, although they were still retained by many nations. The development of surface-to-air missiles began in Nazi Germany during the late World War II with missiles such as the Wasserfall, though no working system was deployed before the war's end, and represented new attempts to increase effectiveness of the anti-aircraft systems faced with growing threat from [bomber]s. Land-based SAMs can be deployed from fixed installations or mobile launchers, either wheeled or tracked. The tracked vehicles are usually armoured vehicles specifically designed to carry SAMs.\n\nQ: Where were surface-to-air missiles first developed?\n\nA: in Nazi Germany\n\nTitle: Basal-cell carcinoma\n\nBackground: in the United States alone. Up to 30% of Caucasians develop basal-cell carcinomas in their lifetime.

In the United States approximately 3 out of 10 caucasians develop a basal-cell carcinoma during their lifetime. This tumor accounts for approximately 70% of non-melanoma skin cancers. In 80 percent of all cases, basal-cell carcinoma affects the skin of head and neck.

        "prompt": "Title: History_of_science\n\nBackground: The renewal of learning in Europe, that began with 12th century Scholasticism, came to an end about the time of the Black Death, and the initial period of the subsequent Italian Renaissance is sometimes seen as a lull in scientific activity. The Northern Renaissance, on the other hand, showed a decisive shift in focus from Aristoteleian natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences (botany, anatomy, and medicine). Thus modern science in Europe was resumed in a period of great upheaval: the Protestant Reformation and Catholic Counter-Reformation; the discovery of the Americas by Christopher Columbus; the Fall of Constantinople; but also the re-discovery of Aristotle during the Scholastic period presaged large social and political changes. Thus, a suitable environment was created in which it became possible to question scientific doctrine, in much the same way that Martin Luther and John Calvin questioned religious doctrine. The works of Ptolemy (astronomy) and Galen (medicine) were found not always to match everyday observations. Work by Vesalius on human cadavers found problems with the Galenic view of anatomy.\n\nQ: What began at the same time Scholasticism ended?\n\nA: the Black Death\n\nTitle: Treaty\n\nBackground: Another situation can occur when one party wishes to create an obligation under international law, but the other party does not.

Just over twice as many (73 of 76 on board) had perished when the helium-filled U.S. Navy scout airship crashed at sea off the New Jersey coast four years earlier on April 4, 1933. Some of the survivors were saved by luck. Werner Franz, the 14-year-old cabin boy, was initially dazed by the realization that the ship was on fire. As he stood near the officer's mess where he had been putting away dishes moments before, a water tank holding ballast above him burst open, and he was suddenly soaked.

Argonne National Laboratory's Experimental Breeder Reactor I, located at the Atomic Energy Commission's National Reactor Testing Station near Arco, Idaho, became the first nuclear reactor to create electricity on 20 December 1951. Initially, four 150-watt light bulbs were lit by the reactor, but improvements eventually enabled it to power the whole facility (later, the town of Arco became the first in the world to have all its electricity come from nuclear power generated by BORAX-III, another reactor designed and operated by Argonne National Laboratory). The world's first commercial scale nuclear power station, Obninsk in the Soviet Union, began generation with its reactor AM-1 on 27 June 1954. Other early nuclear power plants were Calder Hall in England, which began generation on 17 October 1956, and the Shippingport Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania, which began on 26 May 1958.

Zhang encountered Dayuan (Fergana), Kangju (Sogdiana), and Daxia (Bactria, formerly the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom); he also gathered information on Shendu (Indus River valley of North India) and Anxi (the Parthian Empire). All of these countries eventually received Han embassies. These connections marked the beginning of the Silk Road trade network that extended to the Roman Empire, bringing Han items like silk to Rome and Roman goods such as glasswares to China.\n\nQ: When did Zhang Qian end his travels?\n\nA: 125 BC\n\nTitle: Qing_dynasty\n\nBackground: China also began suffering from mounting overpopulation during this period. Population growth was stagnant for the first half of the 17th century due to civil wars and epidemics, but prosperity and internal stability gradually reversed this trend. The introduction of new crops from the Americas such as the potato and peanut allowed an improved food supply as well, so that the total population of China during the 18th century ballooned from 100 million to 300 million people. Soon all available farmland was used up, forcing peasants to work ever-smaller and more intensely worked plots. The Qianlong Emperor once bemoaned the country's situation by remarking \"The population continues to grow, but the land does not.\" The only remaining part of the empire that had arable farmland was Manchuria, where the provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang had been walled off as a Manchu homeland. The emperor decreed for the first time that Han Chinese civilians were forbidden to settle. Mongols were forbidden by the Qing from crossing the borders of their banners, even into other Mongol Banners and from crossing into neidi (the Han Chinese 18 provinces) and were given serious punishments if they did in order to keep the Mongols divided against each other to benefit the Qing.\n\nQ: What was the last part of China with farmland left?\n\nA: Manchuria\n\nTitle: Netherlands\n\nBackground: the south-eastern province of Limburg.

Submarines strangled Japan by sinking its merchant fleet, intercepting many troop transports, and cutting off nearly all the oil imports essential to weapons production and military operations. By early 1945 Japanese oil supplies were so limited that its fleet was virtually stranded.\n\nQ: What happened to the Japanese fleet when nearly all oil imports were cut off?\n\nA: virtually stranded\n\nTitle: American_Idol\n\nBackground: Some of the later writers about the show were more positive, Michael Slezak, again of Entertainment Weekly, thought that \"for all its bloated, synthetic, product-shilling, money-making trappings, Idol provides a once-a-year chance for the average American to combat the evils of today's music business.\" Singer Sheryl Crow, who was later to act as a mentor on the show, however took the view that the show \"undermines art in every way and promotes commercialism\". Pop music critic Ann Powers nevertheless suggested that Idol has \"reshaped the American songbook\", \"led us toward a new way of viewing ourselves in relationship to mainstream popular culture\", and connects \"the classic Hollywood dream to the multicentered popular culture of the future.\" Others focused on the personalities in the show; Ramin Setoodeh of Newsweek accused judge Simon Cowell's cruel critiques in the show of helping to establish in the wider world a culture of meanness, that \"Simon Cowell has dragged the rest of us in the mud with him.\" Some such as singer John Mayer disparaged the contestants, suggesting that those who appeared on Idol are not real artists with self-respect.\n\nQ: What publication does Michael Slezak write for?\n\nA: Entertainment Weekly\n\nTitle: Donie Bush\n\nBackground: and Tom Yawkey (owner of the Boston Red Sox), purchased the club reportedly for $175,000 -- $100,000 for the plant (including a 14,500-seat park built in 1923 for $400,000) and $75,000 for the franchise and players. After taking over the Colonels, Bush lauded the team's shortstop, Pee Wee Reese, as \"the best-looking shortstop prospect he's seen in his 30-odd years in baseball.\" In July 1939, Bush and McKinney recouped much of their investment by trading Reese to the Brooklyn Dodgers for $35,000 and three players.

It was not until after the mid-1960s and passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that they were able to vote in full again, but new devices, such as at-large commission city governments, had been adopted in several jurisdictions to limit their political participation. Former Gov. Winfield Dunn and former U.S. Sen. Bill Brock wins in 1970 helped make the Republican Party competitive among whites for the statewide victory. Tennessee has selected governors from different parties since 1970. Increasingly the Republican Party has become the party of white conservatives.\n\nQ: Which Republican was elected Tennessee Governor in 1970?\n\nA: Winfield Dunn\n\nTitle: Association_football\n\nBackground: Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the penalty area in front of their own goal.

Arno Peters stirred controversy when he proposed what is now usually called the Gall\u2013Peters projection as \"the\" alternative to the Mercator. The projection he promoted is a specific parameterization of the cylindrical equal-area projection. In response, a 1989 resolution by seven North American geographical groups deprecated the use of cylindrical projections for general purpose world maps, which would include both the Mercator and the Gall\u2013Peters. Many major online street mapping services (Bing Maps, OpenStreetMap, Google Maps, MapQuest, Yahoo!

In prefix pairs, the perfective verb has an added prefix\u2014for example, the imperfective ps\u00e1t (to write, to be writing) compared with the perfective napsat (to write down, to finish writing). The most common prefixes are na-, o-, po-, s-, u-, vy-, z- and za-. In suffix pairs, a different infinitive ending is added to the perfective stem; for example, the perfective verbs koupit (to buy) and prodat (to sell) have the imperfective forms kupovat and prod\u00e1vat. Imperfective verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs (iterative and frequentative forms), denoting repeated or regular action.

A major shortcoming of hydralazine monotherapy was that it lost its effectiveness over time (tachyphylaxis). In the mid-1950s Karl H. Beyer, James M. Sprague, John E. Baer, and Frederick C. Novello of Merck and Co. discovered and developed chlorothiazide, which remains the most widely used antihypertensive drug today.

        "prompt": "Title: Poultry\n\nBackground: Guinea fowl originated in southern Africa, and the species most often kept as poultry is the helmeted guineafowl (Numida meleagris). It is a medium-sized grey or speckled bird with a small naked head with colourful wattles and a knob on top, and was domesticated by the time of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Guinea fowl are hardy, sociable birds that subsist mainly on insects, but also consume grasses and seeds. They will keep a vegetable garden clear of pests and will eat the ticks that carry Lyme disease. They happily roost in trees and give a loud vocal warning of the approach of predators. Their flesh and eggs can be eaten in the same way as chickens, young birds being ready for the table at the age of about four months. \n\nQ: What continent is the evolution of guinea fowl credited to?\n\nA: Africa\n\nTitle: Dell\n\nBackground: Dell service and support brands include the Dell Solution Station (extended domestic support services, previously \"Dell on Call\"), Dell Support Center (extended support services abroad), Dell Business Support (a commercial service-contract that provides an industry-certified technician with a lower call-volume than in normal queues), Dell Everdream Desktop Management (\"Software as a Service\" remote-desktop management, originally a SaaS company founded by Elon Musk's cousin, Lyndon Rive, which Dell bought in 2007), and Your Tech Team (a support-queue available to home users who purchased their systems either through Dell's website or through Dell phone-centers).\n\nQ: What is the name of the Dell service that gives home-users a support queue?\n\nA: Your Tech Team\n\nTitle: Cypriot refugees\n\nBackground: island) were forced by the advancing Turkish Army to flee south. Likewise, Turkish Cypriots who had not already fled to the enclaves during the intercommunal violence now chose to do so. It is estimated that 40% of the Greek population of Cyprus, as well as over half of the Turkish Cypriot population, were displaced by the Turkish invasion. The figures for internally displaced Cypriots varies, the United Peacekeeping force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) estimates 165,000 Greek Cypriots and 45,000 Turkish Cypriots.

(But Popper criticised what he saw as Kuhn's relativism.) Also, in his collection Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge (Harper & Row, 1963), Popper writes, \"Science must begin with myths, and with the criticism of myths; neither with the collection of observations, nor with the invention of experiments, but with the critical discussion of myths, and of magical techniques and practices. The scientific tradition is distinguished from the pre-scientific tradition in having two layers. Like the latter, it passes on its theories; but it also passes on a critical attitude towards them. The theories are passed on, not as dogmas, but rather with the challenge to discuss them and improve upon them.\"\n\nQ: According to Popper, what second layer does scientific inquiry have that pre-scientific inquiry does not?\n\nA: a critical attitude\n\nTitle: Hanover\n\nBackground: The Schnellweg (en: expressway) system, a number of Bundesstra\u00dfe roads, forms a structure loosely resembling a large ring road together with A2 and A7.

On 2 August 1934, Hindenburg died. The previous day, the cabinet had enacted the \"Law Concerning the Highest State Office of the Reich\", which stated that upon Hindenburg's death the office of president would be abolished and its powers merged with those of the chancellor. Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government and was formally named as \"F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler\" (\"Leader and Chancellor\") \u2013 although eventually \"Reichskanzler\" was quietly dropped.

It reached 2.25 million in 2011. In March 2001, Bertrand Delano\u00eb became the first socialist mayor of Paris. In 2007, in an effort to reduce car traffic in the city, he introduced the V\u00e9lib', a system which rents bicycles for the use of local residents and visitors.

Lord Kilbracken himself criticised The Sun's editorial and the headline of its news story; he stated that while he thought that gay people were more at risk of developing AIDS it was still wrong to imply that no one else could catch the disease. The Press Council condemned The Sun for committing what it called a \"gross distortion\". The Sun later ran an apology, which they ran on Page 28. Journalist David Randall argued in the textbook The Universal Journalist that The Sun's story was one of the worst cases of journalistic malpractice in recent history, putting its own readers in harm's way.\n\nQ: What did Lord Kilbracken think of The Sun's editorial?\n\nA: Lord Kilbracken himself criticised The Sun's editorial and the headline of its news story\n\nTitle: Cuban peso\n\nBackground: either currency, with exchange charts posted by the tills.

        "prompt": "Title: Pacific_War\n\nBackground: The Battle of Leyte Gulf was arguably the largest naval battle in history and was the largest naval battle of World War II. It was a series of four distinct engagements fought off the Philippine island of Leyte from 23 to 26 October 1944. Leyte Gulf featured the largest battleships ever built, was the last time in history that battleships engaged each other, and was also notable as the first time that kamikaze aircraft were used. Allied victory in the Philippine Sea established Allied air and sea superiority in the western Pacific. Nimitz favored blockading the Philippines and landing on Formosa. This would give the Allies control of the sea routes to Japan from southern Asia, cutting off substantial Japanese garrisons. MacArthur favored an invasion of the Philippines, which also lay across the supply lines to Japan. Roosevelt adjudicated in favor of the Philippines. Meanwhile, Japanese Combined Fleet Chief Toyoda Soemu prepared four plans to cover all Allied offensive scenarios. On 12 October Nimitz launched a carrier raid against Formosa to make sure that planes based there could not intervene in the landings on Leyte. Toyoda put Plan Sho-2 into effect, launching a series of air attacks against the U.S. carriers. However the Japanese lost 600 planes in three days, leaving them without air cover.\n\nQ: What did Nimitz favor blockading?\n\nA: Philippines\n\nTitle: Gamal_Abdel_Nasser\n\nBackground: Through his actions and speeches, and because he was able to symbolize the popular Arab will, Nasser inspired several nationalist revolutions in the Arab world.

The extent of Nasser's centrality in the region made it a priority for incoming Arab nationalist heads of state to seek good relations with Egypt, in order to gain popular legitimacy from their own citizens.\n\nQ: What did other Arab leaders have to do to gain admiration of their populations?\n\nA: seek good relations with Egypt\n\nTitle: Glossary of sake terms\n\nBackground: Glossary of sake terms This glossary of sake terms lists some of terms and definitions involved in making sake, and some terms which also apply to other beverages such as beer. Sake, also referred to as a Japanese rice wine, is an alcoholic beverage made by fermenting rice that has been polished to remove the bran. Unlike wine, in which alcohol is produced by fermenting sugar that is naturally present in fruit, sake is produced by a brewing process more akin to that of beer, where starch is converted into sugars which ferment into alcohol.

Following the failed rebellion of his elder brothers between 1173 and 1174, however, John became Henry's favourite child. He was appointed the Lord of Ireland in 1177 and given lands in England and on the continent. John's elder brothers William, Henry and Geoffrey died young; by the time Richard I became king in 1189, John was a potential heir to the throne. John unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against Richard's royal administrators whilst his brother was participating in the Third Crusade. Despite this, after Richard died in 1199, John was proclaimed King of England, and came to an agreement with Philip II of France to recognise John's possession of the continental Angevin lands at the peace treaty of Le Goulet in 1200.\n\nQ: Who unsuccessfully attempted a rebellion against Richard's royal administrators?\n\nA: John\n\nTitle: New_Haven,_Connecticut\n\nBackground: The New Haven Division buses follow routes that had originally been covered by trolley service.

In the 1920s and 1930s, some of the trolley lines began to be replaced by bus lines, with the last trolley route converted to bus in 1948.

With a mass of 340 billion solar masses, they generate a significant amount of ultraviolet and mid-infrared light. They are thought to have an increased star formation rate around 30 times faster than the Milky Way. Despite the prominence of large elliptical and spiral galaxies, most galaxies in the Universe are dwarf galaxies.

Turkic tribesmen were first used in the Abbasid army as mamluks (slave-warriors), replacing Iranian and Arab elements within the army. As a result, the mamluks gained a significant political power. In 999, large portions of Iran came briefly under the rule of the Ghaznavids, whose rulers were of mamluk Turk origin, and longer subsequently under the Turkish Seljuk and Khwarezmian empires. These Turks had been Persianized and had adopted Persian models of administration and rulership. The Seljuks subsequently gave rise to the Sultanate of Rum in Anatolia, while taking their thoroughly Persianized identity with them. The result of the adoption and patronage of Persian culture by Turkish rulers was the development of a distinct Turko-Persian tradition.\n\nQ: In what year did the Ghaznavids briefly control large portions of Iran?\n\nA: 999\n\nTitle: Michael J.

        "prompt": "Title: Phonology\n\nBackground: Government phonology, which originated in the early 1980s as an attempt to unify theoretical notions of syntactic and phonological structures, is based on the notion that all languages necessarily follow a small set of principles and vary according to their selection of certain binary parameters. That is, all languages' phonological structures are essentially the same, but there is restricted variation that accounts for differences in surface realizations. Principles are held to be inviolable, though parameters may sometimes come into conflict.

After his death, his teachings on apostolic poverty gained currency among Arnoldists, and later more widely among Waldensians and the Spiritual Franciscans, though no written word of his has survived the official condemnation. In the early 1170s, Peter Waldo founded the Waldensians. He advocated an interpretation of the Gospel that led to conflicts with the Roman Catholic Church. By 1215, the Waldensians were declared heretical and subject to persecution. Despite that, the movement continues to exist to this day in Italy, as a part of the wider Reformed tradition.\n\nQ: In what year were the Waldensians labeled as heretics?\n\nA: 1215\n\nTitle: Gymnastics\n\nBackground: Gymnasts sprint down a runway, which is a maximum of 25 meters in length, before hurdling onto a spring board.

The gymnast then rotates to a standing position. In advanced gymnastics, multiple twists and somersaults may be added before landing. Successful vaults depend on the speed of the run, the length of the hurdle, the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle, the kinesthetic awareness in the air, and the speed of rotation in the case of more difficult and complex vaults.\n\nQ: Who gets to chose where a gymnast starts to run on the runway?\n\nA: The gymnast\n\nTitle: United States Power Squadrons\n\nBackground: United States Power Squadrons The United States Power Squadrons (USPS) is a non-profit educational organization, founded in 1914, whose mission is to improve maritime safety and enjoyability through classes in seamanship, navigation, and .

        "prompt": "Title: Insect\n\nBackground: Insects were among the earliest terrestrial herbivores and acted as major selection agents on plants. Plants evolved chemical defenses against this herbivory and the insects, in turn, evolved mechanisms to deal with plant toxins. Many insects make use of these toxins to protect themselves from their predators. Such insects often advertise their toxicity using warning colors. This successful evolutionary pattern has also been used by mimics. Over time, this has led to complex groups of coevolved species. Conversely, some interactions between plants and insects, like pollination, are beneficial to both organisms. Coevolution has led to the development of very specific mutualisms in such systems.\n\nQ: What did plants eventually form against insects?\n\nA: chemical defenses\n\nTitle: LaserDisc\n\nBackground: PAL LaserDiscs have a slightly longer playing time than NTSC discs, but have fewer audio options. PAL discs only have two audio tracks, consisting of either two analog-only tracks on older PAL LDs, or two digital-only tracks on newer discs. In comparison, later NTSC LDs are capable of carrying four tracks (two analog and two digital). On certain releases, one of the analog tracks is used to carry a modulated AC-3 signal for 5.1 channel audio (for decoding and playback by newer LD players with an \"AC-3 RF\" output). However, older NTSC LDs made before 1984 (such as the original DiscoVision discs) only have two analog audio tracks.\n\nQ: Which two audio options are available on PAL LaserDiscs?\n\nA: two analog-only tracks on older PAL LDs, or two digital-only tracks on newer discs\n\nTitle: History of the National Football League\n\nBackground: on their television advertising over disagreements with how the NFL handled the National Anthem protests.

Some pipework from the previous Hill organ of 1848 was revoiced and incorporated in the new scheme. The two organ cases, designed in the late 19th century by John Loughborough Pearson, were re-instated and coloured in 1959.\n\nQ: When was the organ built? \n\nA: 1937\n\nTitle: Dialect\n\nBackground: Many historical linguists view any speech form as a dialect of the older medium of communication from which it developed.[citation needed] This point of view sees the modern Romance languages as dialects of Latin, modern Greek as a dialect of Ancient Greek, Tok Pisin as a dialect of English, and North Germanic as dialects of Old Norse. This paradigm is not entirely problem-free. It sees genetic relationships as paramount: the \"dialects\" of a \"language\" (which itself may be a \"dialect\" of a yet older language) may or may not be mutually intelligible. Moreover, a parent language may spawn several \"dialects\" which themselves subdivide any number of times, with some \"branches\" of the tree changing more rapidly than others.\n\nQ: From what language is North Germanic derived?\n\nA: Old Norse\n\nTitle: Colosseum\n\nBackground: appropriated for his own use. In contrast to many other amphitheatres, which were located on the outskirts of a city, the Colosseum was constructed in the city centre; in effect, placing it both symbolically and precisely at the heart of Rome. Construction was funded by the opulent spoils taken from the Jewish Temple after the Great Jewish Revolt in 70 AD led to the Siege of Jerusalem. According to a reconstructed inscription found on the site, \"the emperor Vespasian ordered this new amphitheatre to be erected from his general's share of the booty.\" Along with the spoils, estimated 100,000 Jewish\n\nQ: ['who paid for the building of the colosseum?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Uranium\n\nBackground: A team led by Enrico Fermi in 1934 observed that bombarding uranium with neutrons produces the emission of beta rays (electrons or positrons from the elements produced; see beta particle). The fission products were at first mistaken for new elements of atomic numbers 93 and 94, which the Dean of the Faculty of Rome, Orso Mario Corbino, christened ausonium and hesperium, respectively. The experiments leading to the discovery of uranium's ability to fission (break apart) into lighter elements and release binding energy were conducted by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in Hahn's laboratory in Berlin. Lise Meitner and her nephew, the physicist Otto Robert Frisch, published the physical explanation in February 1939 and named the process \"nuclear fission\". Soon after, Fermi hypothesized that the fission of uranium might release enough neutrons to sustain a fission reaction. Confirmation of this hypothesis came in 1939, and later work found that on average about 2.5 neutrons are released by each fission of the rare uranium isotope uranium-235. Further work found that the far more common uranium-238 isotope can be transmuted into plutonium, which, like uranium-235, is also fissile by thermal neutrons. These discoveries led numerous countries to begin working on the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear power.\n\nQ: What was the name given by Corbino to the incorrectly designated atomic number 94?\n\nA: hesperium\n\nTitle: Xbox_360\n\nBackground: The Xbox 360 sold much better than its predecessor, and although not the best-selling console of the seventh-generation, it is regarded as a success since it strengthened Microsoft as a major force in the console market at the expense of well-established rivals. The inexpensive Nintendo Wii did sell the most console units but eventually saw a collapse of third-party software support in its later years, and it has been viewed by some as a fad since the succeeding Wii U had a poor debut in 2012. The PlayStation 3 struggled for a time due to being too expensive and initially lacking quality titles, making it far less dominant than its predecessor, the PlayStation 2, and it took until late in the PlayStation 3's lifespan for its sales and game titles to reach parity with the Xbox 360. TechRadar proclaimed that \"Xbox 360 passes the baton as the king of the hill \u2013 a position that puts all the more pressure on its successor, Xbox One\".\n\nQ: The Playstation 3 originally struggled for market share for what reasons?\n\nA: due to being too expensive and initially lacking quality titles\n\nTitle: Lyndon B. Johnson\n\nBackground: in 1968, Johnson nominated Fortas to succeed him as Chief Justice of the United States, and nominated Homer Thornberry to succeed Fortas as Associate Justice. However, Fortas's nomination was filibustered by senators, and neither nominee was voted upon by the full Senate. After leaving the presidency in January 1969, Johnson went home to his ranch in Stonewall, Texas, accompanied by former aide and speechwriter Harry J. Middleton, who would draft Johnson's first book, \"The Choices We Face,\" and work with him on his memoirs entitled \"The Vantage Point: Perspectives of the Presidency 1963\u20131969,\" published in 1971.

        "prompt": "Title: Plymouth\n\nBackground: During the Hundred Years' War a French attack (1340) burned a manor house and took some prisoners, but failed to get into the town. In 1403 the town was burned by Breton raiders. In the late fifteenth century a 'castle quadrate' was constructed close to the area now known as The Barbican; it included four round towers, one at each corner, as featured on the city coat of arms. The castle served to protect Sutton Pool, which is where the fleet was based in Plymouth prior to the establishment of Plymouth Dockyard. In 1512 an Act of Parliament was passed for further fortifying Plymouth, and a series of fortifications were then built, including defensive walls at the entrance to Sutton Pool (across which a chain would be extended in time of danger). Defences on St Nicholas Island also date from this time, and a string of six artillery blockhouses were built, including one on Fishers Nose at the south-eastern corner of the Hoe. This location was further strengthened by the building of a fort (later known as Drake's Fort) in 1596, which itself went on to provide the site for the Citadel, established in the 1660s (see below).\n\nQ: In what year during the Hundred Years' War did the French assault Plymouth?\n\nA: 1340\n\nTitle: Egypt\n\nBackground: Egypt recognises only three religions: Islam, Christianity, and Judaism. Other faiths and minority Muslim sects practised by Egyptians, such as the small Bah\u00e1'\u00ed and Ahmadi community, are not recognised by the state and face persecution since they are labelled as far right groups that threaten Egypt's national security. Individuals, particularly Baha'is and atheists, wishing to include their religion (or lack thereof) on their mandatory state issued identification cards are denied this ability (see Egyptian identification card controversy), and are put in the position of either not obtaining required identification or lying about their faith. A 2008 court ruling allowed members of unrecognised faiths to obtain identification and leave the religion field blank.\n\nQ: What 3 religions does Egypt recognise?\n\nA: Islam, Christianity, and Judaism\n\nTitle: Perth, Ontario\n\nBackground: Perth, Ontario Perth () is a town in Eastern Ontario, Canada. It is located on the Tay River, southwest of Ottawa, and is the seat of Lanark County. The town was established as a military settlement in 1816, shortly after the War of 1812. The settlement of Lanark County began in 1815. In that year \"the Settlement forming on the Rideau River\" as it was officially referred to (and which soon became known as \"Perth Military Settlement\") began to function under Military direction.

The Homeric Epics (i.e. Iliad and Odyssey) were especially and generally accepted as part of the Greek past and it was not until the 19th century that scholars began to question Homer's historicity. As part of the Mycenaean heritage that survived, the names of the gods and goddesses of Mycenaean Greece (e.g. Zeus, Poseidon and Hades) became major figures of the Olympian Pantheon of later antiquity.\n\nQ: How did they believe their forebears lived ?\n\nA: Mycenaean period as a glorious era of heroes, closeness of the gods and material wealth\n\nTitle: High-definition_television\n\nBackground: For the commercial naming of a product, the frame rate is often dropped and is implied from context (e.g., a 1080i television set).

This means that the system does not require a large constellation of satellites, but it also limits the coverage to areas on Earth where the satellites are visible. The area that can be serviced is from longitude 70\u00b0E to 140\u00b0E and from latitude 5\u00b0N to 55\u00b0N.

The principal combatants were North and South Korea. Principal allies of South Korea included the United States, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, although many other nations sent troops under the aegis of the United Nations.

Clinical/translational research focuses on studying the disease in a defined and generally immediately patient-applicable way, such as testing a new drug in patients. By contrast, basic science research studies the disease process at a distance, such as seeing whether a suspected carcinogen can cause leukemic changes in isolated cells in the laboratory or how the DNA changes inside leukemia cells as the disease progresses.

        "prompt": "Title: Greeks\n\nBackground: In the religious sphere, this was a period of profound change. The spiritual revolution that took place, saw a waning of the old Greek religion, whose decline beginning in the 3rd century BC continued with the introduction of new religious movements from the East. The cults of deities like Isis and Mithra were introduced into the Greek world. Greek-speaking communities of the Hellenized East were instrumental in the spread of early Christianity in the 2nd and 3rd centuries, and Christianity's early leaders and writers (notably St Paul) were generally Greek-speaking, though none were from Greece. However, Greece itself had a tendency to cling to paganism and was not one of the influential centers of early Christianity: in fact, some ancient Greek religious practices remained in vogue until the end of the 4th century, with some areas such as the southeastern Peloponnese remaining pagan until well into the 10th century AD.\n\nQ: When did the religions of the past begin to dissipate ?\n\nA: decline beginning in the 3rd century BC\n\nTitle: Chihuahua_(state)\n\nBackground: The state has a great diversity due to the large number of microclimates found and dramatic varying terrain.

The most common species of flora found in the mountains are: Pinus, Quercus, Abies, Ficus, Vachellia, Ipomoea, Acacia, Lysiloma, Bursera, Vitex, Tabebuia, Sideroxylon, Cordia, Fouquieria, Pithecellobium. The state is home to one of the largest variation species of the genus Pinus in the world. The lower elevations have a steppe vegetation with a variety of grasses and small bushes.

President Dwight D. Eisenhower established NASA in 1958 with a distinctly civilian (rather than military) orientation encouraging peaceful applications in space science. The National Aeronautics and Space Act was passed on July 29, 1958, disestablishing NASA's predecessor, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA).

However, due to the unsatisfactory performance of the analog format, two Philips research engineers recommended a digital format in March 1974.

During the Paleocene, the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. Supercontinent Laurasia had not yet separated into three continents. Europe and Greenland were still connected. North America and Asia were still intermittently joined by a land bridge, while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate. The Laramide orogeny of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the Rocky Mountains in the American west, which ended in the succeeding epoch. South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas (they joined during the Neogene); the components of the former southern supercontinent Gondwana continued to split apart, with Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia pulling away from each other. Africa was heading north toward Europe, slowly closing the Tethys Ocean, and India began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the Himalayas.\n\nQ: What mountain chain in the Cretaceous was lifted as a result of the Laramide oregeny?\n\nA: the Rocky Mountains\n\nTitle: Dutch_language\n\nBackground: The term Nederduits, however introduced new confusion, since the non standardised dialects spoken in the north of Germany came to be known as Niederdeutsch as well, and thus the Duits reference in the name was dropped, leading to Nederlands as designation to refer to the Dutch language. The repeated use of Neder (or \"low\") to refer to the Dutch language is a reference to the Netherlands' downriver location at the Rhine\u2013Meuse\u2013Scheldt delta near the North Sea, harking back to Latin nomenclature, e.g. Germania Inferior.

        "prompt": "Title: Alsace\n\nBackground: At the same time, some Alsatians were in opposition to the Jacobins and sympathetic to the invading forces of Austria and Prussia who sought to crush the nascent revolutionary republic. Many of the residents of the Sundgau made \"pilgrimages\" to places like Mariastein Abbey, near Basel, in Switzerland, for baptisms and weddings. When the French Revolutionary Army of the Rhine was victorious, tens of thousands fled east before it. When they were later permitted to return (in some cases not until 1799), it was often to find that their lands and homes had been confiscated. These conditions led to emigration by hundreds of families to newly vacant lands in the Russian Empire in 1803\u20134 and again in 1808. A poignant retelling of this event based on what Goethe had personally witnessed can be found in his long poem Hermann and Dorothea.\n\nQ: What had happened to most of the people who fled Sungau during the war when they were allowed to return home?\n\nA: lands and homes had been confiscated\n\nTitle: Professional_wrestling\n\nBackground: In matches with multiple competitors, an elimination system may be used. Any wrestler who has a fall scored against them is forced out of the match, and the match continues until only one remains. However, it is much more common when more than two wrestlers are involved to simply go one fall, with the one scoring the fall, regardless of who they scored it against, being the winner. In championship matches, this means that, unlike one-on-one matches (where the champion can simply disqualify themselves or get themselves counted out to retain the title via the \"champion's advantag\"), the champion does not have to be pinned or involved in the decision to lose the championship. However, heel champions often find advantages, not in champion's advantage, but in the use of weapons and outside interference, as these poly-sided matches tend to involve no holds barred rules.\n\nQ: What kind of rules does a poly-sided match usually have?\n\nA: no holds barred rules\n\nTitle: Constituent state\n\nBackground: republic, however, the government of Palau is centralised and these divisions exist solely to establish regional government; they are not united in a federal union. Like Palau, the government of Myanmar, or Burma, presently operates as a unitary state, with sovereignty confined within the central government. Burma comprises a number of \"states\", which exist alongside the country's regional divisions. Both \"states\" and \"divisions\" can be described as ethnically defined; while the Bamar remain predominant within divisions, the states are mostly dominated by minority groups. In terms of politics, the use of the term \"state\" in this context is largely historical,\n\nQ: ['what type of government does burma (myanmar) have?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Poultry\n\nBackground: \"Poultry\" is a term used for any kind of domesticated bird, captive-raised for its utility, and traditionally the word has been used to refer to wildfowl (Galliformes) and waterfowl (Anseriformes). \"Poultry\" can be defined as domestic fowls, including chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks, raised for the production of meat or eggs and the word is also used for the flesh of these birds used as food. The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica lists the same bird groups but also includes guinea fowl and squabs (young pigeons). In R. D. Crawford's Poultry breeding and genetics, squabs are omitted but Japanese quail and common pheasant are added to the list, the latter frequently being bred in captivity and released into the wild. In his 1848 classic book on poultry, Ornamental and Domestic Poultry: Their History, and Management, Edmund Dixon included chapters on the peafowl, guinea fowl, mute swan, turkey, various types of geese, the muscovy duck, other ducks and all types of chickens including bantams. In colloquial speech, the term \"fowl\" is often used near-synonymously with \"domesticated chicken\" (Gallus gallus), or with \"poultry\" or even just \"bird\", and many languages do not distinguish between \"poultry\" and \"fowl\". Both words are also used for the flesh of these birds. Poultry can be distinguished from \"game\", defined as wild birds or mammals hunted for food or sport, a word also used to describe the flesh of these when eaten.\n\nQ: What two addtional types of birds are listed in teh Encyclopedia Britanica as poultry?\n\nA: guinea fowl and squabs (young pigeons)\n\nTitle: Kievan_Rus%27\n\nBackground: Prior to the emergence of Kievan Rus' in the 9th century AD, the lands between the Baltic Sea and Black Sea were primarily populated by eastern Slavic tribes. In the northern region around Novgorod were the Ilmen Slavs and neighboring Krivichi, who occupied territories surrounding the headwaters of the West Dvina, Dnieper, and Volga Rivers. To their north, in the Ladoga and Karelia regions, were the Finnic Chud tribe. In the south, in the area around Kiev, were the Poliane, a group of Slavicized tribes with Iranian origins, the Drevliane to the west of the Dnieper, and the Severiane to the east. To their north and east were the Vyatichi, and to their south was forested land settled by Slav farmers, giving way to steppelands populated by nomadic herdsmen.\n\nQ: Where was the Finnic Chud Tripe located curing this time period?\n\nA: Ladoga and Karelia regions\n\nTitle: Desktop publishing\n\nBackground: computer and WYSIWYG page layout software to create publication documents on a computer for either large scale publishing or small scale local multifunction peripheral output and distribution. Desktop publishing methods provide more control over design, layout, and typography than word processing. However, word processing software has evolved to include some, though by no means all, capabilities previously available only with professional printing or desktop publishing. The same DTP skills and software used for common paper and book publishing are sometimes used to create graphics for point of sale displays, promotional items, trade show exhibits, retail package designs and outdoor signs.\n\nQ: ['what is desktop publishing?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Aircraft_carrier\n\nBackground: An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Aircraft carriers have evolved from converted cruisers to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft.\n\nQ: What do aircraft carriers allow naval forces to accomplish?\n\nA: project air power worldwide without depending on local bases\n\nTitle: Human_Development_Index\n\nBackground: Economists Hendrik Wolff, Howard Chong and Maximilian Auffhammer discuss the HDI from the perspective of data error in the underlying health, education and income statistics used to construct the HDI. They identified three sources of data error which are due to (i) data updating, (ii) formula revisions and (iii) thresholds to classify a country\u2019s development status and conclude that 11%, 21% and 34% of all countries can be interpreted as currently misclassified in the development bins due to the three sources of data error, respectively. The authors suggest that the United Nations should discontinue the practice of classifying countries into development bins because - they claim - the cut-off values seem arbitrary, can provide incentives for strategic behavior in reporting official statistics, and have the potential to misguide politicians, investors, charity donors and the public who use the HDI at large.[citation needed] In 2010 the UNDP reacted to the criticism and updated the thresholds to classify nations as low, medium, and high human development countries. In a comment to The Economist in early January 2011, the Human Development Report Office responded to a January 6, 2011 article in the magazine which discusses the Wolff et al. paper. The Human Development Report Office states that they undertook a systematic revision of the methods used for the calculation of the HDI and that the new methodology directly addresses the critique by Wolff et al. in that it generates a system for continuous updating of the human development categories whenever formula or data revisions take place.\n\nQ: How many economists were cited as pointing out data errors in the HDI?\n\nA: three\n\nTitle: Flag of Germany\n\nBackground: emperor in 1871, and was used until 1918 with the end of the First World War. Black, white, and red were reintroduced as the German national colours with the establishment of Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler in 1933, replacing German republican colours with imperial colours until the end of World War II. The colours of the modern flag are associated with the republican democracy first proposed in 1848, formed after World War I, and represent German unity and freedom. During the Weimar Republic, the black-red-gold colours were the colours of the democratic, centrist, and republican political parties, as seen in\n\nQ: ['what are the colors of the german flag?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Gregorian_calendar\n\nBackground: In conjunction with the system of months there is a system of weeks. A physical or electronic calendar provides conversion from a given date to the weekday, and shows multiple dates for a given weekday and month. Calculating the day of the week is not very simple, because of the irregularities in the Gregorian system. When the Gregorian calendar was adopted by each country, the weekly cycle continued uninterrupted. For example, in the case of the few countries that adopted the reformed calendar on the date proposed by Gregory XIII for the calendar's adoption, Friday, 15 October 1582, the preceding date was Thursday, 4 October 1582 (Julian calendar).\n\nQ: What was the previous day's date by the Julian calendar?\n\nA: Thursday, 4 October 1582\n\nTitle: Pharmaceutical_industry\n\nBackground: Prior to the second world war, birth control was prohibited in many countries, and in the United States even the discussion of contraceptive methods sometimes led to prosecution under Comstock laws. The history of the development of oral contraceptives is thus closely tied to the birth control movement and the efforts of activists Margaret Sanger, Mary Dennett, and Emma Goldman. Based on fundamental research performed by Gregory Pincus and synthetic methods for progesterone developed by Carl Djerassi at Syntex and by Frank Colton at G.D. Searle & Co., the first oral contraceptive, Enovid, was developed by E.D. Searle and Co. and approved by the FDA in 1960. The original formulation incorporated vastly excessive doses of hormones, and caused severe side effects. Nonetheless, by 1962, 1.2 million American women were on the pill, and by 1965 the number had increased to 6.5 million. The availability of a convenient form of temporary contraceptive led to dramatic changes in social mores including expanding the range of lifestyle options available to women, reducing the reliance of women on men for contraceptive practice, encouraging the delay of marriage, and increasing pre-marital co-habitation.\n\nQ: Birth control was prohibited in most countries before what war?\n\nA: second world war\n\nTitle: Mason\u2013Dixon line\n\nBackground: engaged in hostilities. As such the group was forced to quit, and on October 11, they made their final observations, from their starting point. In 1784, surveyors David Rittenhouse and Andrew Ellicott and their crew completed the survey of the Mason\u2013Dixon line to the southwest corner of Pennsylvania, five degrees from the Delaware River. Other surveyors continued west to the Ohio River. The section of the line between the southwestern corner of Pennsylvania and the river is the county line between Marshall and Wetzel counties, West Virginia.

Some of these traditions range from \"Friday Name Tags\" in flying units to an annual \"Mustache Month.\" The use of \"challenge coins\" is a recent innovation that was adopted from the U.S. Army while another cultural tradition unique to the Air Force is the \"roof stomp\", practiced by Air Force members to welcome a new commander or to commemorate another event, such as a retirement.\n\nQ: What organization did the US Air Force adopt \"Challenge Coins\" from?\n\nA: U.S. Army\n\nTitle: Myocardial_infarction\n\nBackground: Most MIs occur due to coronary artery disease. Risk factors include high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, poor diet, and excessive alcohol intake, among others.

MIs are less commonly caused by coronary artery spasms, which may be due to cocaine, significant emotional stress, and extreme cold, among others. A number of tests are useful to help with diagnosis, including electrocardiograms (ECGs), blood tests, and coronary angiography. An ECG may confirm an ST elevation MI if ST elevation is present.

Firstly, the fundamental physical laws are time-reversal invariant; if a cinematographic film were taken of any process describable by means of the aforementioned laws and then played backwards, it would still portray a physically possible process. Secondly, our experience of time, at the macroscopic level, is not time-reversal invariant. Glasses can fall and break, but shards of glass cannot reassemble and fly up onto tables.

Pan-Slavism became compromised when the Russian Empire started to use it as an ideology justifying its territorial conquests in Central Europe as well as subjugation of other ethnic groups of Slavic origins such as Poles and Ukrainians, and the ideology became associated with Russian imperialism. The common Slavic experience of communism combined with the repeated usage of the ideology by Soviet propaganda after World War II within the Eastern bloc (Warsaw Pact) was a forced high-level political and economic hegemony of the USSR dominated by Russians.

        "prompt": "Title: Presbyterianism\n\nBackground: Presbyterianism is the largest Protestant denomination in Northern Ireland and the second largest on the island of Ireland (after the Anglican Church of Ireland),[citation needed] and was brought by Scottish plantation settlers to Ulster who had been strongly encouraged to emigrate by James VI of Scotland, later James I of England. An estimated 100,000 Scottish Presbyterians moved to the northern counties of Ireland between 1607 and the Battle of the Boyne in 1690.[citation needed] The Presbytery of Ulster was formed in 1642 separately from the established Anglican Church. Presbyterians, along with Roman Catholics in Ulster and the rest of Ireland, suffered under the discriminatory Penal Laws until they were revoked in the early 19th century. Presbyterianism is represented in Ireland by the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Free Presbyterian Church of Ulster, the Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland, the Reformed Presbyterian Church of Ireland and the Evangelical Presbyterian Church.\n\nQ: When was he Presbytery of Ulster formed?\n\nA: 1642\n\nTitle: Dutch_Republic\n\nBackground: In theory, the stadtholders were freely appointed by and subordinate to the states of each province. However, in practice the princes of Orange of the House of Orange-Nassau, beginning with William the Silent, were always chosen as stadtholders of most of the provinces. Zeeland and usually Utrecht had the same stadtholder as Holland.\n\nQ: Who appointed the stadtholders?\n\nA: the states of each province\n\nTitle: Speed of light\n\nBackground: Speed of light The speed of light in vacuum, commonly denoted , is a universal physical constant important in many areas of physics. Its exact value is (approximately ). It is exact because by international agreement a metre is defined to be the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299792458 second. According to special relativity, is the maximum speed at which all conventional matter and hence all known forms of information in the universe can travel.

Later western theistic idealism such as that of Hermann Lotze offers a theory of the \"world ground\" in which all things find their unity: it has been widely accepted by Protestant theologians. Several modern religious movements, for example the organizations within the New Thought Movement and the Unity Church, may be said to have a particularly idealist orientation. The theology of Christian Science includes a form of idealism: it teaches that all that truly exists is God and God's ideas; that the world as it appears to the senses is a distortion of the underlying spiritual reality, a distortion that may be corrected (both conceptually and in terms of human experience) through a reorientation (spiritualization) of thought.\n\nQ: In what philosophy was Christian idealism often rooted?\n\nA: Neoplatonism\n\nTitle: Buddhism\n\nBackground: The teachings on the Four Noble Truths are regarded as central to the teachings of Buddhism, and are said to provide a conceptual framework for Buddhist thought.

The daily mean temperature in January, the area's coldest month, is 32.6 \u00b0F (0.3 \u00b0C); however, temperatures usually drop to 10 \u00b0F (\u221212 \u00b0C) several times per winter, and reach 50 \u00b0F (10 \u00b0C) several days each winter month. Spring and autumn are unpredictable and can range from chilly to warm, although they are usually mild with low humidity. Summers are typically warm to hot and humid, with a daily mean temperature of 76.5 \u00b0F (24.7 \u00b0C) in July and an average humidity level of 72%. Nighttime conditions are often exacerbated by the urban heat island phenomenon, while daytime temperatures exceed 90 \u00b0F (32 \u00b0C) on average of 17 days each summer and in some years exceed 100 \u00b0F (38 \u00b0C). In the warmer months, the dew point, a measure of atmospheric moisture, ranges from 57.3 \u00b0F (14.1 \u00b0C) in June to 62.0 \u00b0F (16.7 \u00b0C) in August. Extreme temperatures have ranged from \u221215 \u00b0F (\u221226 \u00b0C), recorded on February 9, 1934, up to 106 \u00b0F (41 \u00b0C) on July 9, 1936.\n\nQ: What mountains serve as a barrier to keep New York City comparatively warmer in the winter?\n\nA: Appalachians\n\nTitle: You Shook Me\n\nBackground: similar claim about Page on a US radio show during the eighties\".

The latter aided in the defence of their respective territories against attacks by other European powers, Aboriginal peoples, and later American forces during the American Revolutionary War and War of 1812, as well as in the Fenian raids, Red River Rebellion, and North-West Rebellion. Consequently, the lineages of some Canadian army units stretch back to the early 19th century, when militia units were formed to assist in the defence of British North America against invasion by the United States.\n\nQ: Early on, what did they defend against with the British?\n\nA: invasion by the United States\n\nTitle: Dialect\n\nBackground: One usage\u2014the more common among linguists\u2014refers to a variety of a language that is a characteristic of a particular group of the language's speakers. The term is applied most often to regional speech patterns, but a dialect may also be defined by other factors, such as social class. A dialect that is associated with a particular social class can be termed a sociolect, a dialect that is associated with a particular ethnic group can be termed as ethnolect, and a regional dialect may be termed a regiolect. According to this definition, any variety of a language constitutes \"a dialect\", including any standard varieties.\n\nQ: What is a term for a dialect particular to a social class?\n\nA: sociolect\n\nTitle: 2009 Nobel Peace Prize\n\nBackground: from the Conservative Party of Norway and one from the right-wing Progress Party.

The difference in styles is due to the independent evolution of the sport in Mexico beginning in the 1930s and the fact that wrestlers in the cruiserweight division (peso semicompleto) are often the most popular wrestlers in Mexican lucha libre. Wrestlers often execute high flying moves characteristic of lucha libre by utilizing the wrestling ring's ropes to catapult themselves towards their opponents, using intricate combinations in rapid-fire succession, and applying complex submission holds.

Beginning with Microsoft's 1979 move from Albuquerque, New Mexico to nearby Bellevue, Washington, Seattle and its suburbs became home to a number of technology companies including Amazon.com, RealNetworks, Nintendo of America, McCaw Cellular (now part of AT&T Mobility), VoiceStream (now T-Mobile), and biomedical corporations such as HeartStream (later purchased by Philips), Heart Technologies (later purchased by Boston Scientific), Physio-Control (later purchased by Medtronic), ZymoGenetics, ICOS (later purchased by Eli Lilly and Company) and Immunex (later purchased by Amgen). This success brought an influx of new residents with a population increase within city limits of almost 50,000 between 1990 and 2000, and saw Seattle's real estate become some of the most expensive in the country. In 1993, the movie Sleepless in Seattle brought the city further national attention. Many of the Seattle area's tech companies remained relatively strong, but the frenzied dot-com boom years ended in early 2001.\n\nQ: What type of establishment was Wan Mee?\n\nA: gambling club\n\nTitle: Montana\n\nBackground: The state also has five Micropolitan Statistical Areas centered on Bozeman, Butte, Helena, Kalispell and Havre. These communities, excluding Havre, are colloquially known as the \"big 7\" Montana cities, as they are consistently the seven largest communities in Montana, with a significant population difference when these communities are compared to those that are 8th and lower on the list. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the population of Montana's seven most populous cities, in rank order, are Billings, Missoula, Great Falls, Bozeman, Butte, Helena and Kalispell. Based on 2013 census numbers, they collectively contain 35 percent of Montana's population. and the counties containing these communities hold 62 percent of the state's population. The geographic center of population of Montana is located in sparsely populated Meagher County, in the town of White Sulphur Springs.\n\nQ: How much of the states population does the \"Big 7\" have?\n\nA: 35 percent\n\nTitle: Genius Junior\n\nBackground: squares, cubes, square roots, and/or cube roots.

German names have been revived in commercial Russian trade and there is sometimes talk of reverting Kaliningrad's name to its historic name of K\u00f6nigsberg. The city centre of Kaliningrad was completely rebuilt, as British bombs in 1944 and the Soviet siege in 1945 had left it in nothing but ruins.\n\nQ: What city was completely rebuilt after the Russians and Germans had bombed it?\n\nA: Kaliningrad\n\nTitle: Greece\n\nBackground: The Byzantine recovery of lost provinces began toward the end of the 8th century and most of the Greek peninsula came under imperial control again, in stages, during the 9th century. This process was facilitated by a large influx of Greeks from Sicily and Asia Minor to the Greek peninsula, while at the same time many Slavs were captured and re-settled in Asia Minor and those that remained were assimilated. During the 11th and 12th centuries the return of stability resulted in the Greek peninsula benefiting from strong economic growth \u2013 much stronger than that of the Anatolian territories of the Empire.\n\nQ: Slavs that were caught were moved to what area?\n\nA: Asia Minor\n\nTitle: Neuropsychology\n\nBackground: Neuropsychology Neuropsychology is the study of the structure and function of the brain as they relate to specific psychological processes and behaviours. It is both an experimental and clinical field of psychology that aims to understand how behavior and cognition are influenced by brain functioning and is concerned with the diagnosis and treatment of behavioral and cognitive effects of neurological disorders. Whereas classical neurology focuses on the physiology of the nervous system and classical psychology is largely divorced from it, neuropsychology seeks to discover how the brain correlates with the mind.

Tritium (hydrogen-3), produced in nuclear reactors, is used in the production of hydrogen bombs, as an isotopic label in the biosciences, and as a radiation source in luminous paints.\n\nQ: What is tritium used for?\n\nA: production of hydrogen bombs, as an isotopic label in the biosciences, and as a radiation source in luminous paints\n\nTitle: British_Empire\n\nBackground: In 1951, the Conservative Party returned to power in Britain, under the leadership of Winston Churchill. Churchill and the Conservatives believed that Britain's position as a world power relied on the continued existence of the empire, with the base at the Suez Canal allowing Britain to maintain its pre-eminent position in the Middle East in spite of the loss of India. However, Churchill could not ignore Gamal Abdul Nasser's new revolutionary government of Egypt that had taken power in 1952, and the following year it was agreed that British troops would withdraw from the Suez Canal zone and that Sudan would be granted self-determination by 1955, with independence to follow.

In 206 BC the Sibylline books commended the introduction of cult to the aniconic Magna Mater (Great Mother) from Pessinus, installed on the Palatine in 191 BC. The mystery cult to Bacchus followed; it was suppressed as subversive and unruly by decree of the Senate in 186 BC. Greek deities were brought within the sacred pomerium: temples were dedicated to Juventas (Hebe) in 191 BC, Diana (Artemis) in 179 BC, Mars (Ares) in 138 BC), and to Bona Dea, equivalent to Fauna, the female counterpart of the rural Faunus, supplemented by the Greek goddess Damia.

        "prompt": "Title: Nigeria\n\nBackground: Nigeria is home to a substantial network of organised crime, active especially in drug trafficking. Nigerian criminal groups are heavily involved in drug trafficking, shipping heroin from Asian countries to Europe and America; and cocaine from South America to Europe and South Africa. . The various Nigerian Confraternities or \"campus cults\" are active in both organised crime and in political violence as well as providing a network of corruption within Nigeria. As confraternities have extensive connections with political and military figures, they offer excellent alumni networking opportunities. The Supreme Vikings Confraternity, for example, boasts that twelve members of the Rivers State House of Assembly are cult members. On lower levels of society, there are the \"area boys\", organised gangs mostly active in Lagos who specialise in mugging and small-scale drug dealing. According to official statistics, gang violence in Lagos resulted in 273 civilians and 84 policemen killed in the period of August 2000 to May 2001.\n\nQ: What is Nigeria's most popular organized-crime activity?\n\nA: drug trafficking\n\nTitle: Heresy\n\nBackground: Another example of the persecution of heretics under Protestant rule was the execution of the Boston martyrs in 1659, 1660, and 1661. These executions resulted from the actions of the Anglican Puritans, who at that time wielded political as well as ecclesiastic control in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. At the time, the colony leaders were apparently hoping to achieve their vision of a \"purer absolute theocracy\" within their colony .[citation needed] As such, they perceived the teachings and practices of the rival Quaker sect as heretical, even to the point where laws were passed and executions were performed with the aim of ridding their colony of such perceived \"heresies\".[citation needed] It should be noticed that the Eastern Orthodox and Oriental Orthodox communions generally regard the Puritans themselves as having been heterodox or heretical.\n\nQ: What rival group did the Anglican Puritans want purged from their area?\n\nA: Quaker sect\n\nTitle: I Just Wanted You to Know\n\nBackground: I Just Wanted You to Know \"I Just Wanted You to Know\" is a song written by Tim Mensy and Gary Harrison and recorded by American country music singer Mark Chesnutt. It was released in November 1993 as the third single from his album \"Almost Goodbye\". The song reached number-one on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart and on the Canadian \"RPM\" Country Tracks chart. The song officially debuted at number 53 on the Hot Country Singles & Tracks chart dated December 18, 1993. It charted for 19 weeks on that chart, and\n\nQ: ['who sings the song i want to know?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Flowering_plant\n\nBackground: While the majority of flowers are perfect or hermaphrodite (having both pollen and ovule producing parts in the same flower structure), flowering plants have developed numerous morphological and physiological mechanisms to reduce or prevent self-fertilization. Heteromorphic flowers have short carpels and long stamens, or vice versa, so animal pollinators cannot easily transfer pollen to the pistil (receptive part of the carpel). Homomorphic flowers may employ a biochemical (physiological) mechanism called self-incompatibility to discriminate between self and non-self pollen grains. In other species, the male and female parts are morphologically separated, developing on different flowers.\n\nQ: Why did flowering plants develop numerous morphological and physiological mechanisms?\n\nA: reduce or prevent self-fertilization\n\nTitle: Tuvalu\n\nBackground: While some commentators have called for the relocation of Tuvalu's population to Australia, New Zealand or Kioa in Fiji, in 2006 Maatia Toafa (Prime Minister from 2004\u20132006) said his government did not regard rising sea levels as such a threat that the entire population would need to be evacuated. In 2013 Enele Sopoaga, the prime minister of Tuvalu, said that relocating Tuvaluans to avoid the impact of sea level rise \"should never be an option because it is self defeating in itself. For Tuvalu I think we really need to mobilise public opinion in the Pacific as well as in the [rest of] world to really talk to their lawmakers to please have some sort of moral obligation and things like that to do the right thing.\"\n\nQ: What did the Tuvalu Prime Minster say was not enough of an immediate threat to cause evacuation of the population? \n\nA: rising sea levels\n\nTitle: Saint Patrick's Day\n\nBackground: saint's day to a time outside those periods. St Patrick's Day is occasionally affected by this requirement, when 17 March falls during Holy Week. This happened in 1940, when Saint Patrick's Day was observed on 3 April to avoid it coinciding with Palm Sunday, and again in 2008, where it was officially observed on 15 March. St Patrick's Day will not fall within Holy Week again until 2160. However, the popular festivities may still be held on 17 March or on a weekend near to the feast day. In 1903, St Patrick's Day became an official public holiday in Ireland.\n\nQ: [\"when is st. patrick's day?\"]\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Guam\n\nBackground: Spanish colonization commenced on June 15, 1668 with the arrival of Diego Luis de San Vitores and Pedro Calungsod, who established the first Catholic church.:64 The islands were part of the Spanish East Indies governed from the Philippines, which were in turn part of the Viceroyalty of New Spain based in Mexico City. Other reminders of colonial times include the old Governor's Palace in Plaza de Espa\u00f1a and the Spanish Bridge, both in Hagat\u00f1a. Guam's Cathedral Dulce Nombre de Maria was formally opened on February 2, 1669, as was the Royal College of San Juan de Letran.:68 Guam, along with the rest of the Mariana and Caroline Islands, were treated as part of Spain's colony in the Philippines. While Guam's Chamorro culture has indigenous roots, the cultures of both Guam and the Northern Marianas have many similarities with Spanish and Mexican culture due to three centuries of Spanish rule.\n\nQ: When did Guam's Cathedral first open?\n\nA: February 2, 1669\n\nTitle: PlayStation_3\n\nBackground: On April 20, 2011, Sony shut down the PlayStation Network and Qriocity for a prolonged interval, revealing on April 23 that this was due to \"an external intrusion on our system\". Sony later revealed that the personal information of 77 million users might have been taken, including: names; addresses; countries; email addresses; birthdates; PSN/Qriocity logins, passwords and handles/PSN online IDs. They also stated that it was possible that users' profile data, including purchase history and billing address, and PlayStation Network/Qriocity password security answers may have been obtained. There was no evidence that any credit card data had been taken, but the possibility could not be ruled out, and Sony advised customers that their credit card data may have been obtained. Additionally, the credit card numbers were encrypted and Sony never collected the three digit CVC or CSC number from the back of the credit cards which is required for authenticating some transactions. In response to the incident, Sony announced a \"Welcome Back\" program, 30 days free membership of PlayStation Plus for all PSN members, two free downloadable PS3 games, and a free one-year enrollment in an identity theft protection program.\n\nQ: What was the date Sony shut down the PS Network because of a security breach?\n\nA: April 20, 2011\n\nTitle: Provinces of Nepal\n\nBackground: has local units. Nepal includes six metropolises, 11 sub-metropolises, 276 municipal councils and 460 village councils. The current system of seven provinces replaced an earlier system where Nepal was divided into 14 Administrative Zones which were grouped into five Development Regions. In January 2018, the Government of Nepal announced temporary headquarters of the seven provinces. According to Article 295 (2), the permanent names of the provinces will be determined by a two-thirds vote of the respective province's legislature. The executive power of the provinces, pursuant to the Constitution and laws, is vested in the Council of Ministers of the province.\n\nQ: ['when was nepal divided into 7 provinces in nepali date?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Northwestern_University\n\nBackground: Like other American research universities, Northwestern was transformed by World War II. Franklyn B. Snyder led the university from 1939 to 1949, when nearly 50,000 military officers and personnel were trained on the Evanston and Chicago campuses. After the war, surging enrollments under the G.I. Bill drove drastic expansion of both campuses. In 1948 prominent anthropologist Melville J. Herskovits founded the Program of African Studies at Northwestern, the first center of its kind at an American academic institution. J. Roscoe Miller's tenure as president from 1949 to 1970 was responsible for the expansion of the Evanston campus, with the construction of the lakefill on Lake Michigan, growth of the faculty and new academic programs, as well as polarizing Vietnam-era student protests. In 1978, the first and second Unabomber attacks occurred at Northwestern University. Relations between Evanston and Northwestern were strained throughout much of the post-war era because of episodes of disruptive student activism, disputes over municipal zoning, building codes, and law enforcement, as well as restrictions on the sale of alcohol near campus until 1972. Northwestern's exemption from state and municipal property tax obligations under its original charter has historically been a source of town and gown tension.\n\nQ: What center was founded by Melville J. Herskovits in 1948?\n\nA: Program of African Studies at Northwestern\n\nTitle: Old_English\n\nBackground: The Latin alphabet of the time still lacked the letters \u27e8j\u27e9 and \u27e8w\u27e9, and there was no \u27e8v\u27e9 as distinct from \u27e8u\u27e9; moreover native Old English spellings did not use \u27e8k\u27e9, \u27e8q\u27e9 or \u27e8z\u27e9. The remaining 20 Latin letters were supplemented by four more: \u27e8\u00e6\u27e9 (\u00e6sc, modern ash) and \u27e8\u00f0\u27e9 (\u00f0\u00e6t, now called eth or edh), which were modified Latin letters, and thorn \u27e8\u00fe\u27e9 and wynn \u27e8\u01bf\u27e9, which are borrowings from the futhorc. A few letter pairs were used as digraphs, representing a single sound. Also used was the Tironian note \u27e8\u204a\u27e9 (a character similar to the digit 7) for the conjunction and, and a thorn with a crossbar through the ascender for the pronoun \u00fe\u00e6t. Macrons over vowels were originally used not to mark long vowels (as in modern editions), but to indicate stress, or as abbreviations for a following m or n.\n\nQ: What number was the Tironian note visually similar to?\n\nA: \u01bf\n\nTitle: Sarabham\n\nBackground: Sarabham Sarabham (English: \"Lion Bird\") is a 2014 Indian Tamil-language neo noir mystery film directed by Arun Mohan, son of Anu Mohan, Tamil film actor and produced by C. V. Kumar under his banner Thirukumaran Entertainment. The film features Naveen Chandra, Salony Luthra and Aadukalam Naren in leading roles, while Britto Michael as music director. The film opened to positive reviews from critics in August 2014.The movie is loosely based on the 2003 Japanese thriller \"Game\" which was also earlier remade in Hindi as \"Woodstock Villa\"(2008).

        "prompt": "Title: Neptune\n\nBackground: The dipole component of the magnetic field at the magnetic equator of Neptune is about 14 microteslas (0.14 G). The dipole magnetic moment of Neptune is about 2.2 \u00d7 1017 T\u00b7m3 (14 \u03bcT\u00b7RN3, where RN is the radius of Neptune). Neptune's magnetic field has a complex geometry that includes relatively large contributions from non-dipolar components, including a strong quadrupole moment that may exceed the dipole moment in strength. By contrast, Earth, Jupiter and Saturn have only relatively small quadrupole moments, and their fields are less tilted from the polar axis. The large quadrupole moment of Neptune may be the result of offset from the planet's centre and geometrical constraints of the field's dynamo generator.\n\nQ: Besides the geometrical constraints of Neptune's dynamo generator, what is another result of the quadrupole moment?\n\nA: the planet's centre\n\nTitle: Daylight_saving_time\n\nBackground: Common agreement about the day's layout or schedule confers so many advantages that a standard DST schedule has generally been chosen over ad hoc efforts to get up earlier. The advantages of coordination are so great that many people ignore whether DST is in effect by altering their nominal work schedules to coordinate with television broadcasts or daylight. DST is commonly not observed during most of winter, because its mornings are darker; workers may have no sunlit leisure time, and children may need to leave for school in the dark. Since DST is applied to many varying communities, its effects may be very different depending on their culture, light levels, geography, and climate; that is why it is hard to make generalized conclusions about the absolute effects of the practice. Some areas may adopt DST simply as a matter of coordination with others rather than for any direct benefits.\n\nQ: What indirect benefit of DST might cause some areas to observe it even though they don't get any direct benefits like cost or energy savings?\n\nA: coordination with others\n\nTitle: Nuclear power\n\nBackground: is a sustainable energy source that reduces carbon emissions and increases energy security by decreasing dependence on imported energy sources. Proponents claim that nuclear power produces virtually no conventional air pollution, such as greenhouse gases and smog, in contrast to the main alternative of fossil-fuel power stations. Nuclear power can produce base-load power unlike many renewables which are intermittent energy sources lacking large-scale and cheap ways of storing energy. M. King Hubbert saw oil as a resource that would run out, and proposed nuclear energy as a replacement energy source. Proponents claim that the risks of storing waste are small\n\nQ: ['what is nuclear power?']\n\nA:",

The city entered the 20th century with one of the world's first successful electric streetcar systems, as well as a national hub of African-American commerce and culture, the Jackson Ward neighborhood.\n\nQ: What famous speech did Patrick Henry give in Richmond?\n\nA: Give me liberty or give me death\n\nTitle: The Lion King (2019 film)\n\nBackground: In November, talking with ComingSoon.net, Favreau said the virtual cinematography technology he used in \"The Jungle Book\" would be used to a greater degree in \"The Lion King\". Although the media reported \"The Lion King\" to be a live-action film, it actually utilizes photorealistic computer-generated animation. Disney also did not describe it as live-action, only stating it would follow the \"technologically groundbreaking\" approach of \"The Jungle Book\". In mid-February 2017, Donald Glover was cast as Simba, with James Earl Jones reprising his role as Mufasa from the 1994 film.

        "prompt": "Title: Glass\n\nBackground: In 2004, NIST researchers presented evidence that an isotropic non-crystalline metallic phase (dubbed \"q-glass\") could be grown from the melt. This phase is the first phase, or \"primary phase,\" to form in the Al-Fe-Si system during rapid cooling. Interestingly, experimental evidence indicates that this phase forms by a first-order transition. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images show that the q-glass nucleates from the melt as discrete particles, which grow spherically with a uniform growth rate in all directions. The diffraction pattern shows it to be an isotropic glassy phase. Yet there is a nucleation barrier, which implies an interfacial discontinuity (or internal surface) between the glass and the melt.\n\nQ: What is q-glass?\n\nA: an isotropic non-crystalline metallic phase\n\nTitle: Saint_Helena\n\nBackground: A minibus offers a basic service to carry people around Saint Helena, with most services designed to take people into Jamestown for a few hours on weekdays to conduct their business.

The first clear written reference of the sobriquet Somali, however, dates back to the 15th century.

        "prompt": "Title: Emotion\n\nBackground: Theories dealing with perception either use one or multiples perceptions in order to find an emotion (Goldie, 2007).A recent hybrid of the somatic and cognitive theories of emotion is the perceptual theory. This theory is neo-Jamesian in arguing that bodily responses are central to emotions, yet it emphasizes the meaningfulness of emotions or the idea that emotions are about something, as is recognized by cognitive theories. The novel claim of this theory is that conceptually-based cognition is unnecessary for such meaning. Rather the bodily changes themselves perceive the meaningful content of the emotion because of being causally triggered by certain situations. In this respect, emotions are held to be analogous to faculties such as vision or touch, which provide information about the relation between the subject and the world in various ways. A sophisticated defense of this view is found in philosopher Jesse Prinz's book Gut Reactions, and psychologist James Laird's book Feelings.\n\nQ: What is Jesse Prinz's profession?\n\nA: philosopher\n\nTitle: Miami\n\nBackground: Miami International Airport and PortMiami are among the nation's busiest ports of entry, especially for cargo from South America and the Caribbean.

Additionally, the city has the largest concentration of international banks in the country, primarily along Brickell Avenue in Brickell, Miami's financial district. Due to its strength in international business, finance and trade, many international banks have offices in Downtown such as Esp\u00edrito Santo Financial Group, which has its U.S. headquarters in Miami.

They advance him to a time in life where he is free of his nagging wife and is now old enough for it be respectable for him to take it easy and play with children, working when he wants to instead of when he has to, supported by his loving, grown children.\n\nQ: ['how long did rip van winkle sleep?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Idealism\n\nBackground: In addition, Hegel does believe we can know the structure of God's mind, or ultimate reality. Hegel agrees with Kierkegaard that both reality and humans are incomplete, inasmuch as we are in time, and reality develops through time. But the relation between time and eternity is outside time and this is the \"logical structure\" that Hegel thinks we can know. Kierkegaard disputes this assertion, because it eliminates the clear distinction between ontology and epistemology. Existence and thought are not identical and one cannot possibly think existence. Thought is always a form of abstraction, and thus not only is pure existence impossible to think, but all forms in existence are unthinkable; thought depends on language, which merely abstracts from experience, thus separating us from lived experience and the living essence of all beings. In addition, because we are finite beings, we cannot possibly know or understand anything that is universal or infinite such as God, so we cannot know God exists, since that which transcends time simultaneously transcends human understanding.\n\nQ: What sort of reality did Hegel perceive God's mind to be?\n\nA: ultimate\n\nTitle: Elizabeth_II\n\nBackground: During the war, plans were drawn up to quell Welsh nationalism by affiliating Elizabeth more closely with Wales. Proposals, such as appointing her Constable of Caernarfon Castle or a patron of Urdd Gobaith Cymru (the Welsh League of Youth), were abandoned for various reasons, which included a fear of associating Elizabeth with conscientious objectors in the Urdd, at a time when Britain was at war. Welsh politicians suggested that she be made Princess of Wales on her 18th birthday. Home Secretary, Herbert Morrison supported the idea, but the King rejected it because he felt such a title belonged solely to the wife of a Prince of Wales and the Prince of Wales had always been the heir apparent. In 1946, she was inducted into the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales.\n\nQ: Why did Britain not want Elizabeth to associate with conscientious objectors?\n\nA: Britain was at war\n\nTitle: Cricket World Cup hosts\n\nBackground: hosted the first three competitions.

Norman Holmes Pearson, who worked for the Office of Strategic Studies in London during World War II, returned to Yale and headed the new American studies program, in which scholarship quickly became an instrument of promoting liberty. Popular among undergraduates, the program sought to instruct them in the fundamentals of American civilization and thereby instill a sense of nationalism and national purpose. Also during the 1940s and 1950s, Wyoming millionaire William Robertson Coe made large contributions to the American studies programs at Yale University and at the University of Wyoming.

The campaign strategy, dubbed \"K1C2\", was to focus on attacking the Truman and Roosevelt administrations on three issues: Korea, Communism and corruption.

A UN envoy reported in March 2013 that unrest had re-emerged between Myanmar's Buddhist and Muslim communities, with violence spreading to towns that are located closer to Yangon. The BBC News media outlet obtained video footage of a man with severe burns who received no assistance from passers-by or police officers even though he was lying on the ground in a public area. The footage was filmed by members of the Burmese police force in the town of Meiktila and was used as evidence that Buddhists continued to kill Muslims after the European Union sanctions were lifted on 23 April 2013.\n\nQ: Who recorded the visual evidence on the disdainful incident?\n\nA: footage was filmed by members of the Burmese police force in the town of Meiktila\n\nTitle: Steven_Spielberg\n\nBackground: In 1958, he became a Boy Scout and fulfilled a requirement for the photography merit badge by making a nine-minute 8 mm film entitled The Last Gunfight. Years later, Spielberg recalled to a magazine interviewer, \"My dad's still-camera was broken, so I asked the scoutmaster if I could tell a story with my father's movie camera. He said yes, and I got an idea to do a Western. I made it and got my merit badge. That was how it all started.\" At age thirteen, while living in Phoenix, Spielberg won a prize for a 40-minute war film he titled Escape to Nowhere, using a cast composed of other high school friends. That motivated him to make 15 more amateur 8mm films.:548 In 1963, at age sixteen, Spielberg wrote and directed his first independent film, a 140-minute science fiction adventure called Firelight, which would later inspire Close Encounters. The film was made for $500, most of which came from his father, and was shown in a local cinema for one evening, which earned back its cost.\n\nQ: What genre was Spielberg's first film \"The Last Gunfight\"\n\nA: Western\n\nTitle: National Enquirer\n\nBackground: York City, where it originally began as The New York Enquirer in 1926.

As partial payment of his loan, Hearst asked Griffin to use the \"Enquirer\" as a proving ground for new ideas. Hearst took the ideas that worked in his successful publications; the less successful ideas stayed with the \"Enquirer\", and as a result the \"Enquirer\"s sales never soared.

The eight months of bombing never seriously hampered British production and the war industries continued to operate and expand. The Blitz was only authorised when the Luftwaffe had failed to meet preconditions for a 1940 launch of Operation Sea Lion, the provisionally planned German invasion of Britain. By May 1941 the threat of an invasion of Britain had passed, and Hitler's attention had turned to Operation Barbarossa in the East. In comparison to the later Allied bombing campaign against Germany, the Blitz resulted in relatively few casualties; the British bombing of Hamburg in July 1943 inflicted some 42,000 civilian deaths, about the same as the entire Blitz.\n\nQ: How many people died in the bombing of Hamburg?\n\nA: 42,000\n\nTitle: Software_testing\n\nBackground: Specification-based testing aims to test the functionality of software according to the applicable requirements.

She was paid a $125 salary each week, which was more than some of the human actors (the Singer Midgets who played the Munchkins reportedly received $50 to $100 a week).

Only the Quire of the intended building was completed. Eton's first Headmaster, William Waynflete, founder of Magdalen College, Oxford and previously Head Master of Winchester College, built the ante-chapel that finishes the Chapel today. The important wall paintings in the Chapel and the brick north range of the present School Yard also date from the 1480s; the lower storeys of the cloister, including College Hall, had been built between 1441 and 1460.\n\nQ: Between what years was College Hall built?\n\nA: 1441 and 1460\n\nTitle: Daylight_saving_time\n\nBackground: DST clock shifts sometimes complicate timekeeping and can disrupt travel, billing, record keeping, medical devices, heavy equipment, and sleep patterns.

The population density is 10,178.7 inhabitants per square mile (3,930.4/km\u00b2). There are 47,863 housing units at an average density of 5,794.0 per square mile (2,237.3/km\u00b2).

Musical forms began to break from the Classical era forms (even as those were being codified), with free-form pieces like nocturnes, fantasias, and preludes being written where accepted ideas about the exposition and development of themes were ignored or minimized. The music became more chromatic, dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms of the older forms) about key signatures increasing. The art song (or Lied) came to maturity in this era, as did the epic scales of grand opera, ultimately transcended by Richard Wagner's Ring cycle.\n\nQ: Free-form pieces like nocturnes and preludes were a break from what era?\n\nA: Classical\n\nTitle: Zindzi Mandela-Hlongwane\n\nBackground: With then ANC president Oliver Tambo's health deteriorating, Mandela was elected as the new ANC president and a candidate for the President of South Africa in the upcoming 1994 general elections.

        "prompt": "Title: Emotion\n\nBackground: In economics, the social science that studies the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services, emotions are analyzed in some sub-fields of microeconomics, in order to assess the role of emotions on purchase decision-making and risk perception. In criminology, a social science approach to the study of crime, scholars often draw on behavioral sciences, sociology, and psychology; emotions are examined in criminology issues such as anomie theory and studies of \"toughness,\" aggressive behavior, and hooliganism. In law, which underpins civil obedience, politics, economics and society, evidence about people's emotions is often raised in tort law claims for compensation and in criminal law prosecutions against alleged lawbreakers (as evidence of the defendant's state of mind during trials, sentencing, and parole hearings). In political science, emotions are examined in a number of sub-fields, such as the analysis of voter decision-making.\n\nQ: Along with risk perception, what do economists study emotion in relate to?\n\nA: purchase decision-making\n\nTitle: War_on_Terror\n\nBackground: U.S. President Barack Obama has rarely used the term, but in his inaugural address on 20 January 2009, he stated \"Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.\" In March 2009 the Defense Department officially changed the name of operations from \"Global War on Terror\" to \"Overseas Contingency Operation\" (OCO). In March 2009, the Obama administration requested that Pentagon staff members avoid use of the term, instead using \"Overseas Contingency Operation\". Basic objectives of the Bush administration \"war on terror\", such as targeting al Qaeda and building international counterterrorism alliances, remain in place. In December 2012, Jeh Johnson, the General Counsel of the Department of Defense, stated that the military fight will be replaced by a law enforcement operation when speaking at Oxford University, predicting that al Qaeda will be so weakened to be ineffective, and has been \"effectively destroyed\", and thus the conflict will not be an armed conflict under international law. In May 2013, Obama stated that the goal is \"to dismantle specific networks of violent extremists that threaten America\"; which coincided with the U.S. Office of Management and Budget having changed the wording from \"Overseas Contingency Operations\" to \"Countering Violent Extremism\" in 2010.\n\nQ: What was the \"Global War on Terror\" officially renamed to in March 2009?\n\nA: Overseas Contingency Operation\n\nTitle: Flag of Canada\n\nBackground: the new maple leaf flag was raised.

Of the flag, Vanier said \"[it] will symbolize to each of us\u2014and to the world\u2014the unity of purpose and high resolve to which destiny beckons us\". Maurice Bourget, Speaker of the Senate, said: \"The flag is the symbol of the nation's unity, for it, beyond any doubt, represents all the citizens of Canada without distinction of race, language, belief, or opinion.\" Yet there was still opposition to the change, and Stanley's life was even threatened for having \"assassinated the flag\".

        "prompt": "Title: New_Haven,_Connecticut\n\nBackground: In 1954, then-mayor Richard C. Lee began some of the earliest major urban renewal projects in the United States. Certain sections of downtown New Haven were redeveloped to include museums, new office towers, a hotel, and large shopping complexes. Other parts of the city were affected by the construction of Interstate 95 along the Long Wharf section, Interstate 91, and the Oak Street Connector. The Oak Street Connector (Route 34), running between Interstate 95, downtown, and The Hill neighborhood, was originally intended as a highway to the city's western suburbs but was only completed as a highway to the downtown area, with the area to the west becoming a boulevard (See \"Redevelopment\" below).\n\nQ: What did the western portion of Route 34 ultimately become?\n\nA: a boulevard\n\nTitle: Jews\n\nBackground: Throughout history, many rulers, empires and nations have oppressed their Jewish populations or sought to eliminate them entirely. Methods employed ranged from expulsion to outright genocide; within nations, often the threat of these extreme methods was sufficient to silence dissent. The history of antisemitism includes the First Crusade which resulted in the massacre of Jews; the Spanish Inquisition (led by Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada) and the Portuguese Inquisition, with their persecution and autos-da-f\u00e9 against the New Christians and Marrano Jews; the Bohdan Chmielnicki Cossack massacres in Ukraine; the Pogroms backed by the Russian Tsars; as well as expulsions from Spain, Portugal, England, France, Germany, and other countries in which the Jews had settled. According to a 2008 study published in the American Journal of Human Genetics, 19.8% of the modern Iberian population has Sephardic Jewish ancestry, indicating that the number of conversos may have been much higher than originally thought.\n\nQ: Who led the Spanish Inquisition?\n\nA: Tom\u00e1s de Torquemada\n\nTitle: Space Race\n\nBackground: about , and guided the Lunar Module to a safe landing spot at 20:18:04 UTC, July 20, 1969 (3:17:04 pm CDT). The first humans on the Moon waited six hours before they left their craft. At 02:56 UTC, July 21 (9:56 pm CDT July 20), Armstrong became the first human to set foot on the Moon. The first step was witnessed by at least one-fifth of the population of Earth, or about 723 million people. His first words when he stepped off the LM's landing footpad were, \"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\" Aldrin\n\nQ: ['who was the first person to set foot on the moon?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Israel\n\nBackground: Although Turkey and Israel did not establish full diplomatic relations until 1991, Turkey has cooperated with the State since its recognition of Israel in 1949. Turkey's ties to the other Muslim-majority nations in the region have at times resulted in pressure from Arab and Muslim states to temper its relationship with Israel. Relations between Turkey and Israel took a downturn after the 2008\u201309 Gaza War and Israel's raid of the Gaza flotilla. IHH, which organized the flotilla, is a Turkish charity that has been challenged on ties to Hamas and Al-Qaeda. Relations between Israel and Greece have improved since 1995 due to the decline of Israeli-Turkish relations. The two countries have a defense cooperation agreement and in 2010, the Israeli Air Force hosted Greece\u2019s Hellenic Air Force in a joint exercise at the Uvda base. Israel is the second largest importer of Greek products in the Middle East. The joint Cyprus-Israel oil and gas explorations centered on the Leviathan gas field are an important factor for Greece, given its strong links with Cyprus. Cooperation in the world's longest sub-sea electric power cable, the EuroAsia Interconnector, has strengthened relations between Cyprus and Israel.\n\nQ: When did Turkey and Israel establish full diplomatic relations?\n\nA: 1991\n\nTitle: Gene\n\nBackground: The concept of a gene continues to be refined as new phenomena are discovered. For example, regulatory regions of a gene can be far removed from its coding regions, and coding regions can be split into several exons. Some viruses store their genome in RNA instead of DNA and some gene products are functional non-coding RNAs. Therefore, a broad, modern working definition of a gene is any discrete locus of heritable, genomic sequence which affect an organism's traits by being expressed as a functional product or by regulation of gene expression.\n\nQ: What are some gene products?\n\nA: functional non-coding RNAs\n\nTitle: Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith\n\nBackground: The films would be re-released in chronological order beginning with \"The Phantom Menace\" on February 10, 2012. \"Revenge of the Sith\" was originally scheduled to be re-released in 3D on October 11, 2013 (later pushed up to October 4, 2013). However, on January 28, 2013, Lucasfilm announced that it was postponing the 3D release of episodes \"II\" and \"III\" in order to \"focus 100 percent of our efforts on \"\"\" and that further information about 3D release plans would be issued at a later date.

This forbade the king to pass any new law without the consent of the representatives of the nobility, in Sejm and Senat assembled, and thus greatly strengthened the nobility's political position. Basically, this act transferred legislative power from the king to the Sejm. This date commonly marks the beginning of the First Rzeczpospolita, the period of a szlachta-run \"Commonwealth\".\n\nQ: Who granted the act Act of \"Nihil novi nisi commune consensu\"?\n\nA: King Alexander I Jagiellon\n\nTitle: Norfolk_Island\n\nBackground: As of 2004[update], 2532 telephone main lines are in use, a mix of analog (2500) and digital (32) circuits.

She signed an agreement with Deng Xiaoping to award the colony the special status within China of a \"Special Administrative Region\". Under the terms of the agreement, China was obliged to leave Hong Kong's economic status unchanged after the handover on 1 July 1997, for a period of at least fifty years. At the Dublin European Council in November 1979, Thatcher argued that the United Kingdom paid far more to the European Economic Community (EEC) than it received in spending.

        "prompt": "Title: Southampton\n\nBackground: The status of the town was changed by a later charter of Charles I by at once the formal separation from Portsmouth and the recognition of Southampton as a county, In the charter dated 27 June 1640 the formal title of the town became 'The Town and County of the Town of Southampton'. These charters and Royal Grants, of which there were many, also set out the governance and regulation of the town and port which remained the 'constitution' of the town until the local government organisation of the later Victorian period which from about 1888 saw the setting up of County Councils across England and Wales and including Hampshire County Council who now took on some of the function of Government in Southampton Town. In this regime, The Town and County of the Town of Southampton also became a county borough with shared responsibility for aspects of local government. On 24 February 1964 the status changed again by a Charter of Elizabeth II, creating the City and County of the City of Southampton.\n\nQ: What era in history saw local government begin setting up County Councils in the area?\n\nA: Victorian period\n\nTitle: Nintendo_Entertainment_System\n\nBackground: For its complete North American release, the Nintendo Entertainment System was progressively released over the ensuing years in four different bundles: the Deluxe Set, the Control Deck, the Action Set and the Power Set. The Deluxe Set, retailing at US$199.99 (equivalent to $475 in 2016), included R.O.B., a light gun called the NES Zapper, two controllers, and two Game Paks: Gyromite, and Duck Hunt. The Basic Set, retailing at US$89.99 with no game, and US$99.99 bundled with \"Super Mario Bros.\" The Action Set, retailing in 1988 for US$149.99, came with the Control Deck, two game controllers, an NES Zapper, and a dual Game Pak containing both Super Mario Bros. and Duck Hunt. In 1989, the Power Set included the console, two game controllers, a NES Zapper, a Power Pad, and a triple Game Pak containing Super Mario Bros, Duck Hunt, and World Class Track Meet. In 1990, a Sports Set bundle was released, including the console, an NES Satellite infrared wireless multitap adapter, four game controllers, and a dual Game Pak containing Super Spike V'Ball and Nintendo World Cup. Two more bundle packages were later released using the original model NES console. The Challenge Set of 1992 included the console, two controllers, and a Super Mario Bros. 3 Game Pak for a retail price of US$89.99. The Basic Set, first released in 1987, was repackaged for a retail US$89.99. It included only the console and two controllers, and no longer was bundled with a cartridge. Instead, it contained a book called the Official Nintendo Player's Guide, which contained detailed information for every NES game made up to that point.\n\nQ: The Basic Set sold for how much at release?\n\nA: US$89.99\n\nTitle: Pretoria\n\nBackground: capital and Bloemfontein served as the judicial capital. Between 1910 and 1994, the city was also the capital of the province of Transvaal. (As the capital of the ZAR, Pretoria had superseded Potchefstroom in that role.) On 14 October 1931, Pretoria achieved official city status. When South Africa became a republic in 1961, Pretoria remained its administrative capital. Pretoria is situated approximately north-northeast of Johannesburg in the northeast of South Africa, in a transitional belt between the plateau of the Highveld to the south and the lower-lying Bushveld to the north. It lies at an altitude of about above sea\n\nQ: ['in which province is pretoria?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Hellenistic_period\n\nBackground: After the death of Menander (c. 130 BC), the Kingdom appears to have fragmented, with several 'kings' attested contemporaneously in different regions. This inevitably weakened the Greek position, and territory seems to have been lost progressively. Around 70 BC, the western regions of Arachosia and Paropamisadae were lost to tribal invasions, presumably by those tribes responsible for the end of the Bactrian kingdom. The resulting Indo-Scythian kingdom seems to have gradually pushed the remaining Indo-Greek kingdom towards the east. The Indo-Greek kingdom appears to have lingered on in western Punjab until about 10 AD when finally ended by the Indo-Scythians.\n\nQ: I couldn't could up with another question.

This industry started around 1950, as the country's political makeup changed and ended the country's isolation from the rest of the world. In 1956, air transportation was established and the Tribhuvan Highway, between Kathmandu and Raxaul (at India's border), was started. Separate organizations were created in Kathmandu to promote this activity; some of these include the Tourism Development Board, the Department of Tourism and the Civil Aviation Department. Furthermore, Nepal became a member of several international tourist associations. Establishing diplomatic relations with other nations further accentuated this activity. The hotel industry, travel agencies, training of tourist guides, and targeted publicity campaigns are the chief reasons for the remarkable growth of this industry in Nepal, and in Kathmandu in particular.\n\nQ: Approximately when did the Nepalese tourism industry begin?\n\nA: 1950\n\nTitle: Lhotse\n\nBackground: Lhotse Lhotse ( ; , \"lho rtse\") is the fourth highest mountain in the world at , after Mount Everest, K2, and Kangchenjunga.

In addition to the main summit at above sea level, the mountain comprises the smaller peaks Lhotse Middle (East) at , and Lhotse Shar at .

        "prompt": "Title: Religion_in_ancient_Rome\n\nBackground: Roman religion was thus practical and contractual, based on the principle of do ut des, \"I give that you might give.\" Religion depended on knowledge and the correct practice of prayer, ritual, and sacrifice, not on faith or dogma, although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs. Even the most skeptical among Rome's intellectual elite such as Cicero, who was an augur, saw religion as a source of social order. For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life. Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances. Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities. Some public rituals could be conducted only by women, and women formed what is perhaps Rome's most famous priesthood, the state-supported Vestals, who tended Rome's sacred hearth for centuries, until disbanded under Christian domination.\n\nQ: What characteristics were not inherent in Roman religious practice?\n\nA: faith or dogma\n\nTitle: San_Diego\n\nBackground: The members of the city council are each elected from single member districts within the city. The mayor and city attorney are elected directly by the voters of the entire city. The mayor, city attorney, and council members are elected to four-year terms, with a two-term limit. Elections are held on a non-partisan basis per California state law; nevertheless, most officeholders do identify themselves as either Democrats or Republicans. In 2007, registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by about 7 to 6 in the city, and Democrats currently (as of 2015[update]) hold a 5-4 majority in the city council. The current mayor, Kevin Faulconer, is a Republican.\n\nQ: Who votes in the city's attorney and mayor?\n\nA: voters of the entire city\n\nTitle: Geography of Canada\n\nBackground: Geography of Canada The geography of Canada describes the geographic features of Canada, the world's second largest country in total area. Situated in northern North America (constituting 41% of the continent's area), Canada spans a vast, diverse territory between the North Pacific Ocean to the west and the North Atlantic Ocean to the east and the Arctic Ocean to the north (hence the country's motto \"From sea to sea\"), with the United States to the south (contiguous United States) and northwest (Alaska).

        "prompt": "Title: Montana\n\nBackground: Montana is home to the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation and has a historic big game hunting tradition. There are fall bow and general hunting seasons for elk, pronghorn antelope, whitetail deer and mule deer. A random draw grants a limited number of permits for moose, mountain goats and bighorn sheep. There is a spring hunting season for black bear and in most years, limited hunting of bison that leave Yellowstone National Park is allowed.

Fort Niagara and Fort Carillon on 8 July 1758 fell to sizable British forces, cutting off French frontier forts further west. On 13 September 1759, following a three-month siege of Quebec, General James Wolfe defeated the French on the Plains of Abraham outside the city. The French staged a counteroffensive in the spring of 1760, with initial success at the Battle of Sainte-Foy, but they were unable to retake Quebec, due to British naval superiority following the battle of Neuville. The French forces retreated to Montreal, where on 8 September they surrendered to overwhelming British numerical superiority.\n\nQ: What military advantage brought the success for the British in defending Quebec?\n\nA: British naval superiority\n\nTitle: Court of Historical Review\n\nBackground: through actual courts of law. Shoeless Joe Jackson, though acquitted in 1921 over the 1919 Black Sox Scandal, could no longer play ball professionally nor be admitted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Stories about his presumed guilt continued to be distributed. In 1993, Jackson's innocence was affirmed by the Court of Historical Review. Some International Church of the Foursquare Gospel leaders used the Aimee Semple McPherson ruling in 1990 as a modern vindication by law professionals who re-examined the evidence; agreeing with the earlier grand jury inquiries that there was nothing substantial disproving their founder's 1926 kidnapping story.

Early Islamic philosophy emphasized an inexorable link between science and religion, and the process of ijtihad to find truth\u2014in effect all philosophy was \"political\" as it had real implications for governance. This view was challenged by the \"rationalist\" Mutazilite philosophers, who held a more Hellenic view, reason above revelation, and as such are known to modern scholars as the first speculative theologians of Islam; they were supported by a secular aristocracy who sought freedom of action independent of the Caliphate. By the late ancient period, however, the \"traditionalist\" Asharite view of Islam had in general triumphed.

Han-era Daoists assembled into small groups of hermits who attempted to achieve immortality through breathing exercises, sexual techniques and use of medical elixirs. By the 2nd century AD, Daoists formed large hierarchical religious societies such as the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice.

Zhang Zhung is considered to be the original home of the B\u00f6n religion. By the 1st century BCE, a neighboring kingdom arose in the Yarlung valley, and the Yarlung king, Drigum Tsenpo, attempted to remove the influence of the Zhang Zhung by expelling the Zhang's B\u00f6n priests from Yarlung. He was assassinated and Zhang Zhung continued its dominance of the region until it was annexed by Songtsen Gampo in the 7th century.

On January 9, 1990, after the Armenian parliament voted to include Nagorno-Karabakh within its budget, renewed fighting broke out, hostages were taken, and four Soviet soldiers were killed. On January 11, Popular Front radicals stormed party buildings and effectively overthrew the communist powers in the southern town of Lenkoran. Gorbachev resolved to regain control of Azerbaijan; the events that ensued are known as \"Black January.\" Late on January 19, 1990, after blowing up the central television station and cutting the phone and radio lines, 26,000 Soviet troops entered the Azerbaijani capital Baku, smashing barricades, attacking protesters, and firing into crowds. On that night and during subsequent confrontations (which lasted until February), more than 130 people died \u2013 the majority of whom were civilians. More than 700 civilians were wounded, hundreds were detained, but only a few were actually tried for alleged criminal offenses.\n\nQ: Which two groups saw increasing ethnic conflicts in 1988?\n\nA: Armenians and Azerbaijanis\n\nTitle: Pacific_War\n\nBackground: Allied submarines did not adopt a defensive posture and wait for the enemy to attack. Within hours after the Pearl Harbor attack, in retribution against Japan, Roosevelt promulgated a new doctrine: unrestricted submarine warfare against Japan. This meant sinking any warship, commercial vessel, or passenger ship in Axis-controlled waters, without warning and without help to survivors.[nb 13] At the outbreak of the war in the Pacific the Dutch Admiral in charge of the naval defense of the East Indies, Conrad Helfrich, gave instructions to wage war aggressively. His small force of submarines sank more Japanese ships in the first weeks of the war than the entire British and US navies together, an exploit which earned him the nickname \"Ship-a-day Helfrich\". The Dutch force were in fact the first to sink an enemy warship; On 24 December 1941, HNLMS K XVI torpedoed and sank the Japanese destroyer Sagiri.\n\nQ: When was the first Japanese warship sunk by a submarine?\n\nA: 24 December 1941\n\nTitle: History of Missouri\n\nBackground: in 1848, Saint Louis, Independence, Westport and especially Saint Joseph became departure points for those joining wagon trains to the West.

This is memorialized by the Gateway Arch in St. Louis. In 1848, Kansas City was incorporated on the banks of the Missouri River. In 1860, the Pony Express began its short-lived run carrying mail from Saint Joseph to Sacramento, California.

        "prompt": "Title: Alsace\n\nBackground: At the same time, some Alsatians were in opposition to the Jacobins and sympathetic to the invading forces of Austria and Prussia who sought to crush the nascent revolutionary republic. Many of the residents of the Sundgau made \"pilgrimages\" to places like Mariastein Abbey, near Basel, in Switzerland, for baptisms and weddings. When the French Revolutionary Army of the Rhine was victorious, tens of thousands fled east before it. When they were later permitted to return (in some cases not until 1799), it was often to find that their lands and homes had been confiscated. These conditions led to emigration by hundreds of families to newly vacant lands in the Russian Empire in 1803\u20134 and again in 1808. A poignant retelling of this event based on what Goethe had personally witnessed can be found in his long poem Hermann and Dorothea.\n\nQ: What was the name of the poem by Goethe?\n\nA: Hermann and Dorothea\n\nTitle: Memory\n\nBackground: Much of the current knowledge of memory has come from studying memory disorders, particularly amnesia. Loss of memory is known as amnesia. Amnesia can result from extensive damage to: (a) the regions of the medial temporal lobe, such as the hippocampus, dentate gyrus, subiculum, amygdala, the parahippocampal, entorhinal, and perirhinal cortices or the (b) midline diencephalic region, specifically the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus. There are many sorts of amnesia, and by studying their different forms, it has become possible to observe apparent defects in individual sub-systems of the brain's memory systems, and thus hypothesize their function in the normally working brain. Other neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease can also affect memory and cognition. Hyperthymesia, or hyperthymesic syndrome, is a disorder that affects an individual's autobiographical memory, essentially meaning that they cannot forget small details that otherwise would not be stored. Korsakoff's syndrome, also known as Korsakoff's psychosis, amnesic-confabulatory syndrome, is an organic brain disease that adversely affects memory by widespread loss or shrinkage of neurons within the prefrontal cortex.\n\nQ: Is amnesia only seen in one form?\n\nA: There are many sorts of amnesia,\n\nTitle: Welfare reform\n\nBackground: the 7th Century Islamic System. In the United States, the Great Depression and 1929 crash of the stock market contributed significantly to the formation of the concept of welfare as many Americans struggled economically during those times.

The Ilkhans and the Timurids soon came to adopt the ways and customs of the Iranians, choosing to surround themselves with a culture that was distinctively Iranian.\n\nQ: How many citizens were massacred in Isfahan by Timur in 1387?\n\nA: 70,000 citizens\n\nTitle: Observable universe\n\nBackground: matter in the universe. In 1987, Robert Brent Tully identified the Pisces\u2013Cetus Supercluster Complex, the galaxy filament in which the Milky Way resides. It is about 1 billion light-years across. That same year, an unusually large region with a much lower than average distribution of galaxies was discovered, the Giant Void, which measures 1.3 billion light-years across. Based on redshift survey data, in 1989 Margaret Geller and John Huchra discovered the \"Great Wall\", a sheet of galaxies more than 500 million light-years long and 200 million light-years wide, but only 15 million light-years thick. The existence of this structure escaped\n\nQ: ['how wide is the milky way galaxy?']\n\nA:",

Early humans in the Lower Paleolithic lived in forests and woodlands, which allowed them to collect seafood, eggs, nuts, and fruits besides scavenging. Rather than killing large animals for meat, according to this view, they used carcasses of such animals that had either been killed by predators or that had died of natural causes.

He was the first pope to take the pontifical name of \"John\" upon election in more than 500 years, and his choice settled the complicated question of official numbering attached to this papal name due to the antipope of this name. Pope John XXIII surprised those who expected him to be a caretaker pope by calling the historic Second Vatican Council (1962\u201365), the first session opening on 11 October 1962. His passionate views on equality were summed up in his famous statement, \"We were all made in God's image, and thus, we are all Godly alike.\" John XXIII made many passionate speeches during his pontificate, one of which was on the day that he opened the Second Vatican Council in the middle of the night to the crowd gathered in St. Peter's Square: \"Dear children, returning home, you will find children: give your children a hug and say: This is a hug from the Pope!\"\n\nQ: When was Roncalli elected pope?\n\nA: 28 October 1958\n\nTitle: Sophie Francis\n\nBackground: & Like Mike and is being played on radio stations worldwide.

Less commonly, it can refer to the individual teaching of Calvin himself. The particulars of Calvinist theology may be stated in a number of ways. Perhaps the best known summary is contained in the five points of Calvinism, though these points identify the Calvinist view on soteriology rather than summarizing the system as a whole. Broadly speaking, Calvinism stresses the sovereignty or rule of God in all things \u2014 in salvation but also in all of life.

In 1766\u201381, Henry Cavendish was the first to recognize that hydrogen gas was a discrete substance, and that it produces water when burned, a property which later gave it its name: in Greek, hydrogen means \"water-former\".\n\nQ: When was hydrogen gas artificially produced for the first time?\n\nA: early 16th century\n\nTitle: Armenia\n\nBackground: Turkey also has a long history of poor relations with Armenia over its refusal to acknowledge the Armenian Genocide. Turkey was one of the first countries to recognize the Republic of Armenia (the 3rd republic) after its independence from the USSR in 1991. Despite this, for most of the 20th century and early 21st century, relations remain tense and there are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries due to Turkey's refusal to establish them for numerous reasons. During the Nagorno-Karabakh War and citing it as the reason, Turkey illegally closed its land border with Armenia in 1993. It has not lifted its blockade despite pressure from the powerful Turkish business lobby interested in Armenian markets.\n\nQ: When did Armenia gain independence from the USSR?\n\nA: 1991\n\nTitle: Nicolas Cage\n\nBackground: International Film Festival that he planned to curtail his future acting endeavors to pursue other interests.

In 2007, he created a comic book with his son Weston, called \"Voodoo Child\", which was published by Virgin Comics.

        "prompt": "Title: Dialect\n\nBackground: In addition to having evolved, for the most part, separately from one another and with distinct individual histories, the Latin-based regional Romance languages of Italy are also better classified as separate languages rather than true \"dialects\" due to the often high degree in which they lack mutual intelligibility. Though mostly mutually unintelligible, the exact degree to which the regional Italian languages are mutual unintelligible varies, often correlating with geographical distance or geographical barriers between the languages, with some regional Italian languages that are closer in geographical proximity to each other or closer to each other on the dialect continuum being more or less mutually intelligible. For instance, a speaker of purely Eastern Lombard, a language in Northern Italy's Lombardy region that includes the Bergamasque dialect, would have severely limited mutual intelligibility with a purely standard Italian speaker and would be nearly completely unintelligible to a speaker of a pure Sicilian language variant. Due to Eastern Lombard's status as a Gallo-Italic language, an Eastern Lombard speaker may, in fact, have more mutual intelligibility with a Occitan, Catalan, or French speaker than a standard Italian or Sicilian language speaker. Meanwhile, a Sicilian language speaker would have an greater degree of mutual intelligibility with a speaker of the more closely related Neapolitan language, but far less mutual intelligibility with a person speaking Sicilian Gallo-Italic, a language that developed in isolated Lombard emigrant communities on the same island as the Sicilian language.\n\nQ: From what region of Italy does the Eastern Lombard dialect hail?\n\nA: Lombardy\n\nTitle: Education\n\nBackground: Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.\n\nQ: What methods make up Education?\n\nA: storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research\n\nTitle: Adam Levine\n\nBackground: \"Community\", in the episode from the television series \"Intro to Felt Surrogacy\". In 2015, Levine was featured on the song \"Painkiller\" by Rozzi Crane and the duo, R. City's single \"Locked Away\". In 2016, Levine collaborated with The Lonely Island for the song \"I'm So Humble\", in the film \"\" (also stars Levine). He is also featured as a singer for his band's song \"She Will Be Loved\" in the music rhythm game, \"Band Hero\". Levine has made four notable comic appearances on television.

        "prompt": "Title: Glass\n\nBackground: Glass is in widespread use largely due to the production of glass compositions that are transparent to visible light. In contrast, polycrystalline materials do not generally transmit visible light. The individual crystallites may be transparent, but their facets (grain boundaries) reflect or scatter light resulting in diffuse reflection. Glass does not contain the internal subdivisions associated with grain boundaries in polycrystals and hence does not scatter light in the same manner as a polycrystalline material. The surface of a glass is often smooth since during glass formation the molecules of the supercooled liquid are not forced to dispose in rigid crystal geometries and can follow surface tension, which imposes a microscopically smooth surface. These properties, which give glass its clearness, can be retained even if glass is partially light-absorbing\u2014i.e., colored.\n\nQ: What does glass lack, allowing it to be transparent?\n\nA: internal subdivisions\n\nTitle: Madonna_(entertainer)\n\nBackground: Working with photographer Steven Klein, Madonna completed a 17-minute film called secretprojectrevolution.

With the film she launched the Art for Freedom initiative, which helped to promote \"art and free speech as a means to address persecution and injustice across the globe\".

Madonna's early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the Breakfast Club in 1979. According to author Carol Gnojewski, her first attempts at songwriting are perceived as an important self-revelation, as Madonna said: \"I don't know where [the songs] came from. It was like magic. I'd write a song every day. I said 'Wow, I was meant to do this'.\" Mark Kamins, her first producer, believed that Madonna is \"a much underrated musician and lyricist.\" Rolling Stone has named her \"an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics.\" According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's talent for developing \"incredible\" hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience, even without the influence of the music. As an example, Jarman-Ivens cites the 1985 single \"Into the Groove\" and its line \"Live out your fantasy here with me, just let the music set you free; Touch my body, and move in time, now I know you're mine.\" Madonna's songwriting are often autobiographical over the years, dealing with various themes from love and relationships to self-respect and female empowerment. Her songs also speak about taboo and unconventional issues of their period, such as sexuality and AIDS on Erotica (1992). Many of her lyrics contain innuendos and double entendre, which lead to multiple interpretations among music critics and scholars. Madonna has been nominated for being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame twice, for 2014 and 2016 ceremony. Rolling Stone listed Madonna at number 56 on the \"100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time\".\n\nQ: Who was Madonna's first producer?\n\nA: Mark Kamins\n\nTitle: St._John%27s,_Newfoundland_and_Labrador\n\nBackground: Often compared to San Francisco due to the hilly terrain and steep maze of residential streets, housing in St. John's is typically painted in bright colours. The city council has implemented strict heritage regulations in the downtown area, including restrictions on the height of buildings. These regulations have caused much controversy over the years. With the city experiencing an economic boom a lack of hotel rooms and office space has seen proposals put forward that do not meet the current height regulations. Heritage advocates argue that the current regulations should be enforced while others believe the regulations should be relaxed to encourage economic development.\n\nQ: What US city is St. John's often compared to?\n\nA: San Francisco\n\nTitle: Richard Warren\n\nBackground: the time of the \"Mayflower's\" voyage in 1620, Richard and his wife had five daughters: Mary, Ann, Sarah, Elizabeth and Abigail.

Bradford's recollection of that time: \"Mr. Richard Warren, but his wife and children were lefte behind, and came afterwards.\" The \"Mayflower\" departed Plymouth, England on 6/16 September 1620. The small, ship had 102 passengers and a crew of about 30\u201340 in extremely cramped conditions.

        "prompt": "Title: Macintosh\n\nBackground: Apple was initially reluctant to embrace mice with multiple buttons and scroll wheels. Macs did not natively support pointing devices that featured multiple buttons, even from third parties, until Mac OS X arrived in 2001. Apple continued to offer only single button mice, in both wired and Bluetooth wireless versions, until August 2005, when it introduced the Mighty Mouse. While it looked like a traditional one-button mouse, it actually had four buttons and a scroll ball, capable of independent x- and y-axis movement. A Bluetooth version followed in July 2006. In October 2009, Apple introduced the Magic Mouse, which uses multi-touch gesture recognition (similar to that of the iPhone) instead of a physical scroll wheel or ball. It is available only in a wireless configuration, but the wired Mighty Mouse (re-branded as \"Apple Mouse\") is still available as an alternative. Since 2010, Apple has also offered the Magic Trackpad as a means to control Macintosh desktop computers in a way similar to laptops.\n\nQ: What was the name of the 1st multiple button mouse introduced by Apple?\n\nA: Mighty Mouse\n\nTitle: Namibia\n\nBackground: In response to the 1966 ruling by the International Court of Justice, South-West Africa People's Organisation (SWAPO) military wing, People's Liberation Army of Namibia, a guerrilla group began their armed struggle for independence, but it was not until 1988 that South Africa agreed to end its occupation of Namibia, in accordance with a UN peace plan for the entire region. During the South African occupation of Namibia, white commercial farmers, most of whom came as settlers from South Africa and represented 0.2% of the national population, owned 74% of the arable land. Outside the central-southern area of Namibia (known as the \"Police Zone\" since the German era and which contained the main towns, industries, mines and best arable land), the country was divided into \"homelands\", the version of South African bantustan applied to Namibia, although only a few were actually established because indigenous Namibians often did not cooperate.\n\nQ: What is the central-southern area of Namibia known as?\n\nA: Police Zone\n\nTitle: Ernest Hemingway\n\nBackground: writers submitting pieces to the school newspaper, \"The Trapeze\".

The butterflies tend to be large, such as those from the swallowtail Parnassius family, with a habitat that ranges to 1,800 m (5,906 ft). Twelve species of beetles have habitats up to the snow line; the most beautiful and formerly collected for its colours but now protected is the Rosalia alpina.

The Spanish government has committed itself to have 1 million electric vehicles (fully electric and hybrid cars) in Spain by 2014. The Chairman of Endesa, Borja Prado, together with a former mayor of Madrid, Alberto Ruiz Gallard\u00f3n, and the Chairman of Telef\u00f3nica, C\u00e9sar Alierta, have the phone booth in Madrid which can also be used for recharging electric vehicles.

        "prompt": "Title: Alsace\n\nBackground: Alsace-Lorraine was occupied by Germany in 1940 during the Second World War. Although Germany never formally annexed Alsace-Lorraine, it was incorporated into the Greater German Reich, which had been restructured into Reichsgaue. Alsace was merged with Baden, and Lorraine with the Saarland, to become part of a planned Westmark. During the war, 130,000 young men from Alsace and Lorraine were inducted into the German army against their will (malgr\u00e9-nous) and in some cases, the Waffen SS. Some of the latter were involved in war crimes such as the Oradour-sur-Glane massacre. Most of them perished on the eastern front. The few that could escape fled to Switzerland or joined the resistance. In July 1944, 1500 malgr\u00e9-nous were released from Soviet captivity and sent to Algiers, where they joined the Free French Forces.\n\nQ: Approximately how many Alsace and Lorraine men were forced into the German army during World War II?\n\nA: 130,000\n\nTitle: Queen_(band)\n\nBackground: Queen contributed music directly to the films Flash Gordon (1980), with \"Flash\" as the theme song, and Highlander (the original 1986 film), with \"A Kind of Magic\", \"One Year of Love\", \"Who Wants to Live Forever\", \"Hammer to Fall\", and the theme \"Princes of the Universe\", which was also used as the theme of the Highlander TV series (1992\u20131998). In the United States, \"Bohemian Rhapsody\" was re-released as a single in 1992 after appearing in the comedy film Wayne's World. The single subsequently reached number two on the Billboard Hot 100 (with \"The Show Must Go On\" as the first track on the single) and helped rekindle the band's popularity in North America.\n\nQ: How high did the 1992 Bohemian Rhapsody chart?\n\nA: two\n\nTitle: Geography of North America\n\nBackground: would end North America at the man-made Panama Canal. Islands generally associated with North America include Greenland, the world's largest island, and archipelagos and islands in the Caribbean. The terminology of the Americas is complex, but \"Anglo-America\" can describe Canada and the U.S., while \"Latin America\" comprises Mexico and the countries of Central America and the Caribbean, as well as the entire continent of South America. Natural features of North America include the northern portion of the American Cordillera, represented by the geologically new Rocky Mountains in the west; and the considerably older Appalachian Mountains to the east.

        "prompt": "Title: Franco-Prussian_War\n\nBackground: French infantry were equipped with the breech-loading Chassepot rifle, one of the most modern mass-produced firearms in the world at the time. With a rubber ring seal and a smaller bullet, the Chassepot had a maximum effective range of some 1,500 metres (4,900 ft) with a short reloading time. French tactics emphasised the defensive use of the Chassepot rifle in trench-warfare style fighting\u2014the so-called feu de bataillon. The artillery was equipped with rifled, muzzle-loaded La Hitte guns. The army also possessed a precursor to the machine-gun: the mitrailleuse, which could unleash significant, concentrated firepower but nevertheless lacked range and was comparatively immobile, and thus prone to being easily overrun. The mitrailleuse was mounted on an artillery gun carriage and grouped in batteries in a similar fashion to cannon.\n\nQ: What precedent of the machine gun did the French troops also possess?\n\nA: the mitrailleuse\n\nTitle: The_Bronx\n\nBackground: In the 1990s, New York City began closing the large, public high schools in the Bronx and replacing them with small high schools. Among the reasons cited for the changes were poor graduation rates and concerns about safety. Schools that have been closed or reduced in size include John F. Kennedy, James Monroe, Taft, Theodore Roosevelt, Adlai Stevenson, Evander Childs, Christopher Columbus, Morris, Walton, and South Bronx High Schools. More recently the City has started phasing out large middle schools, also replacing them with smaller schools.\n\nQ: What type of schools is NYC now working on shrinking?\n\nA: large middle schools\n\nTitle: Idaho v. United States\n\nBackground: of the reservation. In 1889, the tribe ceded the northern third of the reservation back to the federal government, including part of Lake Coeur d'Alene, for compensation. Unusually, in contrast to practices at the time, the reservation boundary was drawn across the lake, rather than by the meandering high water line. The agreement stated that it was not binding until ratified by Congress. Prior to Senate ratification of both agreements, Idaho became a state.

        "prompt": "Title: Glacier\n\nBackground: Tidewater glaciers are glaciers that terminate in the sea, including most glaciers flowing from Greenland, Antarctica, Baffin and Ellesmere Islands in Canada, Southeast Alaska, and the Northern and Southern Patagonian Ice Fields. As the ice reaches the sea, pieces break off, or calve, forming icebergs. Most tidewater glaciers calve above sea level, which often results in a tremendous impact as the iceberg strikes the water. Tidewater glaciers undergo centuries-long cycles of advance and retreat that are much less affected by the climate change than those of other glaciers.\n\nQ: Do tidewater glaciers calve above or below sea level?\n\nA: above\n\nTitle: Ann_Arbor,_Michigan\n\nBackground: Ann Arbor's residential neighborhoods contain architectural styles ranging from classic 19th-century and early-20th-century designs to ranch-style houses. Among these homes are a number of kit houses built in the early 20th century. Contemporary-style houses are farther from the downtown district. Surrounding the University of Michigan campus are houses and apartment complexes occupied primarily by student renters. Tower Plaza, a 26-story condominium building located between the University of Michigan campus and downtown, is the tallest building in Ann Arbor. The 19th-century buildings and streetscape of the Old West Side neighborhood have been preserved virtually intact; in 1972, the district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and it is further protected by city ordinances and a nonprofit preservation group.\n\nQ: Which century does the Kit houses belong to?\n\nA: 20th century\n\nTitle: Washington, D.C.\n\nBackground: \"The Washington Post\", founded in 1877, is the oldest and most-read local daily newspaper in Washington. \"\"The Post\"\", as it is popularly called, is well known as the newspaper that exposed the Watergate scandal.

Notable mosques include the East London Mosque in Tower Hamlets, London Central Mosque on the edge of Regent's Park and the Baitul Futuh Mosque of the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community. Following the oil boom, increasing numbers of wealthy Hindus and Middle-Eastern Muslims have based themselves around Mayfair and Knightsbridge in West London. There are large Muslim communities in the eastern boroughs of Tower Hamlets and Newham. Large Hindu communities are in the north-western boroughs of Harrow and Brent, the latter of which is home to Europe's largest Hindu temple, Neasden Temple. London is also home to 42 Hindu temples.

In the mainstream of Georgian style were both Palladian architecture\u2014 and its whimsical alternatives, Gothic and Chinoiserie, which were the English-speaking world's equivalent of European Rococo. From the mid-1760s a range of Neoclassical modes were fashionable, associated with the British architects Robert Adam, James Gibbs, Sir William Chambers, James Wyatt, George Dance the Younger, Henry Holland and Sir John Soane. John Nash was one of the most prolific architects of the late Georgian era known as The Regency style, he was responsible for designing large areas of London.

The settlement was known as Hamwic, which evolved into Hamtun and then Hampton. Archaeological excavations of this site have uncovered one of the best collections of Saxon artefacts in Europe. It is from this town that the county of Hampshire gets its name.\n\nQ: What county in England was named after Hampton?\n\nA: Hampshire\n\nTitle: American_Idol\n\nBackground: The two finalists were Kris Allen and Adam Lambert, both of whom had previously landed in the bottom three at the top five. Allen won the contest in the most controversial voting result since season two. It was claimed, later retracted, that 38 million of the 100 million votes cast on the night came from Allen's home state of Arkansas alone, and that AT&T employees unfairly influenced the votes by giving lessons on power-texting at viewing parties in Arkansas.\n\nQ: Who were the final two contestants on season eight of American Idol?\n\nA: Kris Allen and Adam Lambert\n\nTitle: Abraham Lincoln and slavery\n\nBackground: ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment, abolishing slavery everywhere in the United States. Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in Hardin County, Kentucky (now LaRue County). His family attended a Separate Baptists church, which had strict moral standards and opposed alcohol, dancing, and slavery. The family moved north across the Ohio River to free (i.e., non-slave) territory and made a new start in then Perry County; now Spencer County, Indiana. Lincoln later noted that this move was \"partly on account of slavery\" but mainly due to land title difficulties. As a young man, he settled in the free state of\n\nQ: ['when was abraham lincoln born?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Department_store\n\nBackground: In New York City in 1846, Alexander Turney Stewart established the \"Marble Palace\" on Broadway, between Chambers and Reade streets. He offered European retail merchandise at fixed prices on a variety of dry goods, and advertised a policy of providing \"free entrance\" to all potential customers. Though it was clad in white marble to look like a Renaissance palazzo, the building's cast iron construction permitted large plate glass windows that permitted major seasonal displays, especially in the Christmas shopping season. In 1862, Stewart built a new store on a full city block with eight floors and nineteen departments of dress goods and furnishing materials, carpets, glass and china, toys and sports equipment, ranged around a central glass-covered court. His innovations included buying from manufacturers for cash and in large quantities, keeping his markup small and prices low, truthful presentation of merchandise, the one-price policy (so there was no haggling), simple merchandise returns and cash refund policy, selling for cash and not credit, buyers who searched worldwide for quality merchandise, departmentalization, vertical and horizontal integration, volume sales, and free services for customers such as waiting rooms and free delivery of purchases. His innovations were quickly copied by other department stores.\n\nQ: What selling methods did the Marble Palace use?\n\nA: cash and not credit\n\nTitle: Boston\n\nBackground: Boston is an intellectual, technological, and political center but has lost some important regional institutions, including the acquisition of The Boston Globe by The New York Times, and the loss to mergers and acquisitions of local financial institutions such as FleetBoston Financial, which was acquired by Charlotte-based Bank of America in 2004. Boston-based department stores Jordan Marsh and Filene's have both been merged into the Cincinnati\u2013based Macy's. Boston has experienced gentrification in the latter half of the 20th century, with housing prices increasing sharply since the 1990s. Living expenses have risen, and Boston has one of the highest costs of living in the United States, and was ranked the 129th most expensive major city in the world in a 2011 survey of 214 cities. Despite cost of living issues, Boston ranks high on livability ratings, ranking 36th worldwide in quality of living in 2011 in a survey of 221 major cities.\n\nQ: What year did Bank of America buy FleetBoston Fonancial?\n\nA: 2004\n\nTitle: Nirvana fallacy\n\nBackground: is an example of black and white thinking, in which a person fails to see the complex interplay between multiple component elements of a situation or problem, and, as a result, reduces complex problems to a pair of binary extremes. It is common for arguments which commit this fallacy to omit any specifics about exactly how, or how badly, a proposed solution is claimed to fall short of acceptability, expressing the rejection only in vague terms. Alternatively, it may be combined with the fallacy of misleading vividness, when a specific example of a solution's failure is described in emotionally powerful\n\nQ: ['example of fallacy of argument against the person?']\n\nA:",

In mid-August 2011, the CRTC granted the CBC an extension, until August 31, 2012, to continue operating its analogue transmitters in markets subject to the August 31, 2011 transition deadline. This CRTC decision prevented many markets subject to the transition deadline from losing signals for CBC or Radio-Canada, or both at the transition deadline.

        "prompt": "Title: Cyprus\n\nBackground: In January 1950, the Church of Cyprus organised a referendum under the supervision of clerics and with no Turkish Cypriot participation, where 96% of the participating Greek Cypriots voted in favour of enosis, The Greeks were 80.2% of the total island' s population at the time (census 1946). Restricted autonomy under a constitution was proposed by the British administration but eventually rejected. In 1955 the EOKA organisation was founded, seeking union with Greece through armed struggle. At the same time the Turkish Resistance Organisation (TMT), calling for Taksim, or partition, was established by the Turkish Cypriots as a counterweight. The British had also adopted at the time a policy of \"divide and rule\". Woodhouse, a British official in Cyprus, revealed that then British Foreign Secretary Harold Macmillan \"urged the Britons in Cyprus to stir up the Turks in order to neutralise Greek agitation\". British officials also tolerated the creation of the Turkish underground organisation T.M.T. The Secretary of State for the Colonies in a letter dated 15 July 1958 had advised the Governor of Cyprus not to act against T.M.T despite its illegal actions so as not to harm British relations with the Turkish government.\n\nQ: What is the name of the policy that the British adopted?\n\nA: \"divide and rule\"\n\nTitle: YouTube\n\nBackground: In May 2007, YouTube launched its Partner Program, a system based on AdSense which allows the uploader of the video to share the revenue produced by advertising on the site. YouTube typically takes 45 percent of the advertising revenue from videos in the Partner Program, with 55 percent going to the uploader. There are over a million members of the YouTube Partner Program. According to TubeMogul, in 2013 a pre-roll advertisement on YouTube (one that is shown before the video starts) cost advertisers on average $7.60 per 1000 views. Usually no more than half of eligible videos have a pre-roll advertisement, due to a lack of interested advertisers. Assuming pre-roll advertisements on half of videos, a YouTube partner would earn 0.5 X $7.60 X 55% = $2.09 per 1000 views in 2013.\n\nQ: What percentage of revenue does youtube get for ads on \"partner program\" channels?\n\nA: 45 percent\n\nTitle: Mare Tranquillitatis\n\nBackground: Mare Tranquillitatis Mare Tranquillitatis (Latin for Sea of Tranquility or Sea of Tranquillity; see spelling differences) is a lunar mare that sits within the Tranquillitatis basin on the Moon. The mare material within the basin consists of basalt formed in the intermediate to young age group of the Upper Imbrian epoch. The surrounding mountains are thought to be of the Lower Imbrian epoch, but the actual basin is probably Pre-Nectarian. The basin has irregular margins and lacks a defined multiple-ringed structure.

        "prompt": "Title: Light-emitting_diode\n\nBackground: The first commercial LEDs were commonly used as replacements for incandescent and neon indicator lamps, and in seven-segment displays, first in expensive equipment such as laboratory and electronics test equipment, then later in such appliances as TVs, radios, telephones, calculators, as well as watches (see list of signal uses). Until 1968, visible and infrared LEDs were extremely costly, in the order of US$200 per unit, and so had little practical use. The Monsanto Company was the first organization to mass-produce visible LEDs, using gallium arsenide phosphide (GaAsP) in 1968 to produce red LEDs suitable for indicators. Hewlett Packard (HP) introduced LEDs in 1968, initially using GaAsP supplied by Monsanto. These red LEDs were bright enough only for use as indicators, as the light output was not enough to illuminate an area. Readouts in calculators were so small that plastic lenses were built over each digit to make them legible. Later, other colors became widely available and appeared in appliances and equipment. In the 1970s commercially successful LED devices at less than five cents each were produced by Fairchild Optoelectronics. These devices employed compound semiconductor chips fabricated with the planar process invented by Dr. Jean Hoerni at Fairchild Semiconductor. The combination of planar processing for chip fabrication and innovative packaging methods enabled the team at Fairchild led by optoelectronics pioneer Thomas Brandt to achieve the needed cost reductions. These methods continue to be used by LED producers.\n\nQ: What was one use of early LED light in products?\n\nA: calculators\n\nTitle: Estonia\n\nBackground: Between 1945 and 1989, the share of ethnic Estonians in the population resident within the currently defined boundaries of Estonia dropped to 61%, caused primarily by the Soviet programme promoting mass immigration of urban industrial workers from Russia, Ukraine, and Belarus, as well as by wartime emigration and Joseph Stalin's mass deportations and executions.[citation needed] By 1989, minorities constituted more than one-third of the population, as the number of non-Estonians had grown almost fivefold.\n\nQ: What year did minorities in Estonia make up more than a third of the country?\n\nA: 1989\n\nTitle: Phosphorus (morning star)\n\nBackground: Latin word corresponding to Greek \"Phosphorus\" is \"Lucifer\". It is used in its astronomical sense both in prose and poetry. Poets sometimes personify the star, placing it in a mythological context. Phosphorus (morning star) Phosphorus (Greek \"Ph\u014dsphoros\") is the Morning Star, the planet Venus in its morning appearance. \u03a6\u03b1\u03bf\u03c3\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (\"Phaosphoros\") and \u03a6\u03b1\u03b5\u03c3\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 (\"Phaesphoros\") are forms of the same name in some Greek dialects. This celestial object was named when stars and planets were not always distinguished with modern precision. Another Greek name for the Morning Star is Heosphoros (Greek \"He\u014dsphoros\"), meaning \"Dawn-Bringer\". The form Eosphorus is sometimes met in English,\n\nQ: ['what is phosphorus?']\n\nA:",

Codd, departed from this tradition by insisting that applications should search for data by content, rather than by following links. The relational model employs sets of ledger-style tables, each used for a different type of entity. Only in the mid-1980s did computing hardware become powerful enough to allow the wide deployment of relational systems (DBMSs plus applications). By the early 1990s, however, relational systems dominated in all large-scale data processing applications, and as of 2015[update] they remain dominant : IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server are the top DBMS.

CAA55 was introduced in 1985 with a total playback capacity per side of 55 minutes 5 seconds, reducing the video capacity to resolve bandwidth issues with the inclusion of Digital Audio. Several titles released between 1985 and 1987 were analog audio only due to the length of the title and the desire to keep the film on one disc (e.g., Back to the Future). By 1987, Pioneer had overcome the technical challenges and was able to once again encode in CAA60, allowing a total of 60 minutes 5 seconds. Pioneer further refined CAA, offering CAA45, encoding 45 minutes of material, but filling the entire playback surface of the side. Used on only a handful of titles, CAA65 offered 65 minutes 5 seconds of playback time per side. There are a handful of titles pressed by Technidisc that used CAA50. The final variant of CAA is CAA70, which could accommodate 70 minutes of playback time per side.

These pieces remain with the grain during the mash, and act as a filter bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. Some brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.\n\nQ: At what point does barley have it's hull broken up into pieces?\n\nA: After malting\n\nTitle: Languages of Iceland\n\nBackground: language in Iceland\u201d by virtue of Act No 61/2011, adopted by parliament in 2011.

Some indigenous peoples still live in relative isolation from Western culture and a few are still counted as uncontacted peoples.\n\nQ: Belize, Chile and Greenland are just some countries with sizable populations of what peoples?\n\nA: indigenous\n\nTitle: 1491: New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus\n\nBackground: arrived, smallpox and other epidemics had already swept through cities, due mostly to the natives' lack of immunity to Eurasian diseases. The contrasting approaches of \"High Counters\" and \"Low Counters\" among historians are discussed. Among the former, anthropologist Henry F. Dobyns estimated the number of pre-Columbian Native Americans as close to 100 million, while critics of the High Counters include David Henige, who wrote \"Numbers from Nowhere\" (1998). Mann then goes into the provenance and dating of human remains that may shed light on the period of first settlement of the Americas.

The electric guitar is often emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity, and as a solo lead instrument. Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis. The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums, occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars.

Groups affiliated with churches in the South Bronx erected the Nehemiah Homes with about 1,000 units. The grass roots organization Nos Quedamos' endeavor known as Melrose Commons began to rebuild areas in the South Bronx.

        "prompt": "Title: Macintosh\n\nBackground: Apple was initially reluctant to embrace mice with multiple buttons and scroll wheels. Macs did not natively support pointing devices that featured multiple buttons, even from third parties, until Mac OS X arrived in 2001. Apple continued to offer only single button mice, in both wired and Bluetooth wireless versions, until August 2005, when it introduced the Mighty Mouse. While it looked like a traditional one-button mouse, it actually had four buttons and a scroll ball, capable of independent x- and y-axis movement. A Bluetooth version followed in July 2006. In October 2009, Apple introduced the Magic Mouse, which uses multi-touch gesture recognition (similar to that of the iPhone) instead of a physical scroll wheel or ball. It is available only in a wireless configuration, but the wired Mighty Mouse (re-branded as \"Apple Mouse\") is still available as an alternative. Since 2010, Apple has also offered the Magic Trackpad as a means to control Macintosh desktop computers in a way similar to laptops.\n\nQ: What was the name of the 1st multiple button mouse introduced by Apple?\n\nA: Mighty Mouse\n\nTitle: Strasbourg\n\nBackground: Strasbourg is situated on the eastern border of France with Germany. This border is formed by the River Rhine, which also forms the eastern border of the modern city, facing across the river to the German town Kehl. The historic core of Strasbourg however lies on the Grande \u00cele in the River Ill, which here flows parallel to, and roughly 4 kilometres (2.5 mi) from, the Rhine. The natural courses of the two rivers eventually join some distance downstream of Strasbourg, although several artificial waterways now connect them within the city.\n\nQ: Strasbourg is situated on what border of France and Germany?\n\nA: eastern\n\nTitle: Potsdam Declaration\n\nBackground: decision, the United States Army Air Forces dropped the first atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945, and then the second atomic bomb on the Japanese city of Nagasaki three days later on August 9, 1945. These two bombings devastated the two cities, killing an estimated 129,000\u2013246,000 people and destroying much of the cities' infrastructure as well as military bases and war industries in a matter of seconds in a radius that stretched for more than 1 mile (1.6 kilometers).

        "prompt": "Title: Pope_John_XXIII\n\nBackground: Far from being a mere \"stopgap\" pope, to great excitement, John XXIII called for an ecumenical council fewer than ninety years after the First Vatican Council (Vatican I's predecessor, the Council of Trent, had been held in the 16th century). This decision was announced on 29 January 1959 at the Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls. Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini, who later became Pope Paul VI, remarked to Giulio Bevilacqua that \"this holy old boy doesn't realise what a hornet's nest he's stirring up\". From the Second Vatican Council came changes that reshaped the face of Catholicism: a comprehensively revised liturgy, a stronger emphasis on ecumenism, and a new approach to the world.\n\nQ: Who did Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini later become?\n\nA: Pope Paul VI\n\nTitle: Carnival\n\nBackground: Many towns in Croatia's Kvarner region (and in other parts of the country) observe the Carnival period, incorporating local traditions and celebrating local culture. Just before the end of Carnival, every Kvarner town burns a man-like doll called a \"Jure Pi\u0161kanac\", who is blamed for all the strife of the previous year. The Zvon\u010dari, or bell-ringers, wear bells and large head regalia representing their areas of origin (for example, those from Halubje wear regalia in the shape of animal heads). The traditional Carnival food is fritule, a pastry. This festival can also be called Poklade.\n\nQ: What is the traditional Carnival food?\n\nA: fritule\n\nTitle: Christiaan Barnard\n\nBackground: the second kidney transplant in South Africa in October 1967, the first being done in Johannesburg the previous year.

This heart did beat in the patient's chest for approximately 60 to 90 minutes. The patient, Boyd Rush, died without ever regaining consciousness.

        "prompt": "Title: Mandolin\n\nBackground: The mandolin has been used extensively in the traditional music of England and Scotland for generations. Simon Mayor is a prominent British player who has produced six solo albums, instructional books and DVDs, as well as recordings with his mandolin quartet the Mandolinquents. The instrument has also found its way into British rock music. The mandolin was played by Mike Oldfield (and introduced by Vivian Stanshall) on Oldfield's album Tubular Bells, as well as on a number of his subsequent albums (particularly prominently on Hergest Ridge (1974) and Ommadawn (1975)). It was used extensively by the British folk-rock band Lindisfarne, who featured two members on the instrument, Ray Jackson and Simon Cowe, and whose \"Fog on the Tyne\" was the biggest selling UK album of 1971-1972. The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs. Maggie May by Rod Stewart, which hit No. 1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100, also featured Jackson's playing. It has also been used by other British rock musicians. Led Zeppelin's bassist John Paul Jones is an accomplished mandolin player and has recorded numerous songs on mandolin including Going to California and That's the Way; the mandolin part on The Battle of Evermore is played by Jimmy Page, who composed the song. Other Led Zeppelin songs featuring mandolin are Hey Hey What Can I Do, and Black Country Woman. Pete Townshend of The Who played mandolin on the track Mike Post Theme, along with many other tracks on Endless Wire. McGuinness Flint, for whom Graham Lyle played the mandolin on their most successful single, When I'm Dead And Gone, is another example. Lyle was also briefly a member of Ronnie Lane's Slim Chance, and played mandolin on their hit How Come. One of the more prominent early mandolin players in popular music was Robin Williamson in The Incredible String Band. Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull is a highly accomplished mandolin player (beautiful track Pussy Willow), as is his guitarist Martin Barre. The popular song Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want by The Smiths featured a mandolin solo played by Johnny Marr. More recently, the Glasgow-based band Sons and Daughters featured the mandolin, played by Ailidh Lennon, on tracks such as Fight, Start to End, and Medicine. British folk-punk icons the Levellers also regularly use the mandolin in their songs. Current bands are also beginning to use the Mandolin and its unique sound - such as South London's Indigo Moss who use it throughout their recordings and live gigs. The mandolin has also featured in the playing of Matthew Bellamy in the rock band Muse. It also forms the basis of Paul McCartney's 2007 hit \"Dance Tonight.\" That was not the first time a Beatle played a mandolin, however; that distinction goes to George Harrison on Gone Troppo, the title cut from the 1982 album of the same name. The mandolin is taught in Lanarkshire by the Lanarkshire Guitar and Mandolin Association to over 100 people. Also more recently hard rock supergroup Them Crooked Vultures have been playing a song based primarily using a mandolin. This song was left off their debut album, and features former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones.[citation needed]\n\nQ: Who played the mandolin on the album Tubular Bells? \n\nA: Mike Oldfield\n\nTitle: Jehovah%27s_Witnesses\n\nBackground: On July 26, 1931, at a convention in Columbus, Ohio, Rutherford introduced the new name\u2014Jehovah's witnesses\u2014based on Isaiah 43:10: \"Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah, and my servant whom I have chosen\"\u2014which was adopted by resolution. The name was chosen to distinguish his group of Bible Students from other independent groups that had severed ties with the Society, as well as symbolize the instigation of new outlooks and the promotion of fresh evangelizing methods. In 1932, Rutherford eliminated the system of locally elected elders and in 1938, introduced what he called a \"theocratic\" (literally, God-ruled) organizational system, under which appointments in congregations worldwide were made from the Brooklyn headquarters.\n\nQ: What biblical passage was the name Jehovah's witnesses based on?\n\nA: Isaiah 43:10\n\nTitle: Kollam Beach\n\nBackground: Kollam Beach Kollam Beach, also known as Mahatma Gandhi Beach, is a beach at Kollam city in the Indian state of Kerala.

Some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include virulence, distance traveled by victims, and level of contagiousness. The human strains of Ebola virus, for example, incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after. As a result, the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone. Also, this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye. Thus, the initial stage of Ebola is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging. As a result of the above features, the spread of Ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area. In contrast, the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system. As a result, many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease. Also, the relatively low virulence allows its victims to travel long distances, increasing the likelihood of an epidemic.\n\nQ: What are some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated?\n\nA: virulence, distance traveled by victims, and level of contagiousness\n\nTitle: Immunology\n\nBackground: Most graduate immunology schools follow the AAI courses immunology which are offered throughout numerous schools in the United States. For example, in New York State, there are several universities that offer the AAI courses immunology: Albany Medical College, Cornell University, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York University Langone Medical Center, University at Albany (SUNY), University at Buffalo (SUNY), University of Rochester Medical Center and Upstate Medical University (SUNY). The AAI immunology courses include an Introductory Course and an Advance Course. The Introductory Course is a course that gives students an overview of the basics of immunology.\n\nQ: What does the introductory AAI immunology course do?\n\nA: gives students an overview of the basics of immunology\n\nTitle: Star Wars: From the Adventures of Luke Skywalker\n\nBackground: than blasting through a door.

The scene in the Mos Eisley cantina where Obi-Wan defends Luke involves three aliens, as opposed to two in the film, and Obi-Wan cuts one of them in half. Chewbacca is described as having bright, yellow eyes.

On January 9, 1990, after the Armenian parliament voted to include Nagorno-Karabakh within its budget, renewed fighting broke out, hostages were taken, and four Soviet soldiers were killed. On January 11, Popular Front radicals stormed party buildings and effectively overthrew the communist powers in the southern town of Lenkoran. Gorbachev resolved to regain control of Azerbaijan; the events that ensued are known as \"Black January.\" Late on January 19, 1990, after blowing up the central television station and cutting the phone and radio lines, 26,000 Soviet troops entered the Azerbaijani capital Baku, smashing barricades, attacking protesters, and firing into crowds. On that night and during subsequent confrontations (which lasted until February), more than 130 people died \u2013 the majority of whom were civilians. More than 700 civilians were wounded, hundreds were detained, but only a few were actually tried for alleged criminal offenses.\n\nQ: How many Soviet troops occupied Baku?\n\nA: 26,000\n\nTitle: Turner_Classic_Movies\n\nBackground: In 1996, Turner Broadcasting System merged with Time Warner, which besides placing Turner Classic Movies and Warner Bros. Entertainment under the same corporate umbrella, also gave TCM access to Warner Bros.' library of films released after 1949 (which itself includes other acquired entities such as the Lorimar, Saul Zaentz and National General Pictures libraries); incidentally, TCM had already been running select Warner Bros. film titles through a licensing agreement with the studio that was signed prior to the launch of the channel. In March 1999, MGM paid Warner Bros. and gave up the home video rights to the MGM/UA films owned by Turner to Warner Home Video.\n\nQ: Along with Lorimar and National General Pictures, what library was included in the Warner Bros. library?\n\nA: Saul Zaentz\n\nTitle: Text messaging\n\nBackground: be ruining verbal communication skills for many people.

        "prompt": "Title: Literature\n\nBackground: In the Age of Reason philosophical tracts and speculations on history and human nature integrated literature with social and political developments. The inevitable reaction was the explosion of Romanticism in the later 18th century which reclaimed the imaginative and fantastical bias of old romances and folk-literature and asserted the primacy of individual experience and emotion. But as the 19th-century went on, European fiction evolved towards realism and naturalism, the meticulous documentation of real life and social trends. Much of the output of naturalism was implicitly polemical, and influenced social and political change, but 20th century fiction and drama moved back towards the subjective, emphasising unconscious motivations and social and environmental pressures on the individual. Writers such as Proust, Eliot, Joyce, Kafka and Pirandello exemplify the trend of documenting internal rather than external realities.\n\nQ: What literary movement in the 1700s recalled the fantastical literature of medieval times?\n\nA: Romanticism\n\nTitle: Muammar_Gaddafi\n\nBackground: On the afternoon of Gaddafi's death, NTC Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril publicly revealed the news. Gaddafi's corpse was placed in the freezer of a local market alongside the corpses of Yunis Jabr and Mutassim; the bodies were publicly displayed for four days, with Libyans from all over the country coming to view them. In response to international calls, on 24 October Jibril announced that a commission would investigate Gaddafi's death. On 25 October, the NTC announced that Gaddafi had been buried at an unidentified location in the desert; Al Aan TV showed amateur video footage of the funeral. Seeking vengeance for the killing, Gaddafist sympathisers fatally wounded one of those who had captured Gaddafi, Omran Shaaban, near Bani Walid in September 2012.\n\nQ: Who was the prime minister of the NTC?\n\nA: Mahmoud Jibril\n\nTitle: Juan Ponce de Leo\u0301n\n\nBackground: The colonization attempt was abandoned, and its leader died from his wounds soon after returning to Cuba.

Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n was born in the village of Santerv\u00e1s de Campos in the northern part of what is now the Spanish province of Valladolid.

The Manchurian Campaign of the Russian Empire was fought against the Japanese over Manchuria and Korea. The major theatres of operations were Southern Manchuria, specifically the area around the Liaodong Peninsula and Mukden, and the seas around Korea, Japan, and the Yellow Sea. The resulting campaigns, in which the fledgling Japanese military consistently attained victory over the Russian forces arrayed against them, were unexpected by world observers.

        "prompt": "Title: Serbo-Croatian\n\nBackground: Throughout the history of the South Slavs, the vernacular, literary, and written languages (e.g. Chakavian, Kajkavian, Shtokavian) of the various regions and ethnicities developed and diverged independently. Prior to the 19th century, they were collectively called \"Illyric\", \"Slavic\", \"Slavonian\", \"Bosnian\", \"Dalmatian\", \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\". As such, the term Serbo-Croatian was first used by Jacob Grimm in 1824, popularized by the Vienna philologist Jernej Kopitar in the following decades, and accepted by Croatian Zagreb grammarians in 1854 and 1859. At that time, Serb and Croat lands were still part of the Ottoman and Austrian Empires. Officially, the language was called variously Serbo-Croat, Croato-Serbian, Serbian and Croatian, Croatian and Serbian, Serbian or Croatian, Croatian or Serbian. Unofficially, Serbs and Croats typically called the language \"Serbian\" or \"Croatian\", respectively, without implying a distinction between the two, and again in independent Bosnia and Herzegovina, \"Bosnian\", \"Croatian\", and \"Serbian\" were considered to be three names of a single official language. Croatian linguist Dalibor Brozovi\u0107 advocated the term Serbo-Croatian as late as 1988, claiming that in an analogy with Indo-European, Serbo-Croatian does not only name the two components of the same language, but simply charts the limits of the region in which it is spoken and includes everything between the limits (\u2018Bosnian\u2019 and \u2018Montenegrin\u2019). Today, use of the term \"Serbo-Croatian\" is controversial due to the prejudice that nation and language must match. It is still used for lack of a succinct alternative, though alternative names have been used, such as Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian (BCS), which is often seen in political contexts such as the Hague War Crimes tribunal.\n\nQ: Who first used the term Serbo-Croatian in 1824?\n\nA: Jacob Grimm\n\nTitle: Dell\n\nBackground: Dell facilities in the United States are located in Austin, Texas; Plano, Texas; Nashua, New Hampshire; Nashville, Tennessee; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; Peoria, Illinois; Hillsboro, Oregon (Portland area); Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Eden Prairie, Minnesota (Dell Compellent); Bowling Green, Kentucky; Lincoln, Nebraska; and Miami, Florida.

Upon his return, Broz joined the Communist Party of Yugoslavia. The CPY's influence on the political life of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia was growing rapidly. In the 1920 elections the Communists won 59 seats in the parliament and became the third strongest party. Winning numerous local elections, they gained a stronghold in the second largest city of Zagreb, electing Svetozar Deli\u0107 for mayor. After the assassination of Milorad Dra\u0161kovi\u0107, the Yugoslav Minister of the Interior, by a young communist on 2 August 1921, the CPY was declared illegal under the Yugoslav State Security Act of 1921. During 1920 and 1921 all Communist-won mandates were nullified. Broz continued his work underground despite pressure on Communists from the government. As 1921 began he moved to Veliko Trojstvo near Bjelovar and found work as a machinist. In 1925, Broz moved to Kraljevica where he started working at a shipyard. He was elected as a union leader and a year later he led a shipyard strike. He was fired and moved to Belgrade, where he worked in a train coach factory in Smederevska Palanka. He was elected as Workers' Commissary but was fired as soon as his CPY membership was revealed. Broz then moved to Zagreb, where he was appointed secretary of Metal Workers' Union of Croatia. In 1928, he became the Zagreb Branch Secretary of the CPY. In the same year he was arrested, tried in court for his illegal communist activities, and sent to jail. During his five years at Lepoglava prison he met Mo\u0161a Pijade, who became his ideological mentor.

Nicolas tutored children of the Polish aristocracy, and in 1806 married Justyna Krzy\u017canowska, a poor relative of the Skarbeks, one of the families for whom he worked. Fryderyk was baptized on Easter Sunday, 23 April 1810, in the same church where his parents had married, in Broch\u00f3w. His eighteen-year-old godfather, for whom he was named, was Fryderyk Skarbek, a pupil of Nicolas Chopin. Fryderyk was the couple's second child and only son; he had an elder sister, Ludwika (1807\u201355), and two younger sisters, Izabela (1811\u201381) and Emilia (1812\u201327).

It focuses on a new protagonist, Tagiru Akashi and his partner Gumdramon who embark on a new journey with an older Mikey, Shoutmon, an older Ewan and the revived Damemon, along with other new comrades as they deal with a hidden dimension that lies between the Human World and the Digital World called DigiQuartz. The series finale reintroduces the heroes of the previous five seasons as they all come together and help the current heroes in the final battle due to the fact that the DigiQuartz is essentially a tear in Space and Time, allowing all of the Digimon universes to converge.\n\nQ: What is the dimension called between the human world and digital world?\n\nA: DigiQuartz\n\nTitle: Saint_Helena\n\nBackground: The climate of Saint Helena is tropical, marine and mild, tempered by the Benguela Current and trade winds that blow almost continuously. The climate varies noticeably across the island. Temperatures in Jamestown, on the north leeward shore, range between 21\u201328 \u00b0C (70\u201382 \u00b0F) in the summer (January to April) and 17\u201324 \u00b0C (63\u201375 \u00b0F) during the remainder of the year. The temperatures in the central areas are, on average, 5\u20136 \u00b0C (9.0\u201310.8 \u00b0F) lower. Jamestown also has a very low annual rainfall, while 750\u20131,000 mm (30\u201339 in) falls per year on the higher ground and the south coast, where it is also noticeably cloudier.

Beckford, in his 1975 study of Jehovah's Witnesses, classified the religion's organizational structure as Totalizing, characterized by an assertive leadership, specific and narrow objectives, control over competing demands on members' time and energy, and control over the quality of new members. Other characteristics of the classification include likelihood of friction with secular authorities, reluctance to co-operate with other religious organizations, a high rate of membership turnover, a low rate of doctrinal change, and strict uniformity of beliefs among members. Beckford identified the religion's chief characteristics as historicism (identifying historical events as relating to the outworking of God's purpose), absolutism (conviction that Jehovah's Witness leaders dispense absolute truth), activism (capacity to motivate members to perform missionary tasks), rationalism (conviction that Witness doctrines have a rational basis devoid of mystery), authoritarianism (rigid presentation of regulations without the opportunity for criticism) and world indifference (rejection of certain secular requirements and medical treatments).\n\nQ: What did Beckford classify the Jehovah's Witnesses organizational structure as being?\n\nA: Totalizing\n\nTitle: Chelsea Flower Show\n\nBackground: resume in 1947. The majority of exhibitors wanted a postponement, as stocks of plants were low, staff much depleted and fuel for greenhouses was obtainable only with special permits, but Lord Aberconway (then RHS President) and the RHS Council felt strongly that the show should resume as soon as possible. As it turned out, the show went ahead in 1947 and it was a great success. The coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953 was a sufficient cause for a flower show that reflected the celebratory mood of the country. Most members of the royal family attended that year.

        "prompt": "Title: Kathmandu\n\nBackground: Kumari Ghar is a palace in the center of the Kathmandu city, next to the Durbar square where a Royal Kumari selected from several Kumaris resides. Kumari, or Kumari Devi, is the tradition of worshipping young pre-pubescent girls as manifestations of the divine female energy or devi in South Asian countries. In Nepal the selection process is very rigorous. Kumari is believed to be the bodily incarnation of the goddess Taleju (the Nepali name for Durga) until she menstruates, after which it is believed that the goddess vacates her body. Serious illness or a major loss of blood from an injury are also causes for her to revert to common status. The current Royal Kumari, Matina Shakya, age four, was installed in October 2008 by the Maoist government that replaced the monarchy.\n\nQ: What is Durga called in Nepali?\n\nA: Taleju\n\nTitle: Apollo\n\nBackground: Four days after his birth, Apollo killed the chthonic dragon Python, which lived in Delphi beside the Castalian Spring. This was the spring which emitted vapors that caused the oracle at Delphi to give her prophecies. Hera sent the serpent to hunt Leto to her death across the world. To protect his mother, Apollo begged Hephaestus for a bow and arrows. After receiving them, Apollo cornered Python in the sacred cave at Delphi. Apollo killed Python but had to be punished for it, since Python was a child of Gaia.\n\nQ: Who was Apollo's mother?\n\nA: Leto\n\nTitle: Jackie Stewart\n\nBackground: a race where Stewart had to come into the pits to change a flat tyre, and he drove from 20th to finish 4th. Stewart held the record for most wins by a Formula One driver (27) for 14 years until Alain Prost won the 1987 Portuguese Grand Prix, and the record for most wins by a British Formula One driver for 19 years until Nigel Mansell won the 1992 British Grand Prix.

        "prompt": "Title: Queen_Victoria\n\nBackground: Through Victoria's reign, the gradual establishment of a modern constitutional monarchy in Britain continued. Reforms of the voting system increased the power of the House of Commons at the expense of the House of Lords and the monarch. In 1867, Walter Bagehot wrote that the monarch only retained \"the right to be consulted, the right to encourage, and the right to warn\". As Victoria's monarchy became more symbolic than political, it placed a strong emphasis on morality and family values, in contrast to the sexual, financial and personal scandals that had been associated with previous members of the House of Hanover and which had discredited the monarchy. The concept of the \"family monarchy\", with which the burgeoning middle classes could identify, was solidified.\n\nQ: What kind of government was Victoria's reign leaning towards?\n\nA: modern constitutional monarchy\n\nTitle: Szlachta\n\nBackground: The first \"free election\" (Polish: \"wolna elekcja\") of a king took place in 1492. (To be sure, some earlier Polish kings had been elected with help from bodies such as that which put Casimir II on the throne, thereby setting a precedent for free elections.) Only senators voted in the 1492 free election, which was won by John I Albert. For the duration of the Jagiellonian Dynasty, only members of that royal family were considered for election; later, there would be no restrictions on the choice of candidates.\n\nQ: What dynasty was in reign during the election of 1492?\n\nA: Jagiellonian Dynasty\n\nTitle: Beta thalassemia\n\nBackground: Beta thalassemia Beta thalassemias (\u03b2 thalassemias) are a group of inherited blood disorders. They are forms of thalassemia caused by reduced or absent synthesis of the beta chains of hemoglobin that result in variable outcomes ranging from severe anemia to clinically asymptomatic individuals. Global annual incidence is estimated at one in 100,000. Beta thalassemias are caused by mutations in the \"HBB\" gene on chromosome 11, inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. The severity of the disease depends on the nature of the mutation. HBB blockage over time leads to decreased beta-chain synthesis. The body's inability to construct new beta-chains leads\n\nQ: ['what is thalassemia?']\n\nA:",

From that point until 1918, the legal status of the nobility was essentially dependent upon the policies of the three partitioning powers: the Russian Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Habsburg Monarchy.

        "prompt": "Title: Alexander_Graham_Bell\n\nBackground: During his world tour of 1910\u201311, Bell and Baldwin met with Forlanini in France. They had rides in the Forlanini hydrofoil boat over Lake Maggiore. Baldwin described it as being as smooth as flying. On returning to Baddeck, a number of initial concepts were built as experimental models, including the Dhonnas Beag, the first self-propelled Bell-Baldwin hydrofoil. The experimental boats were essentially proof-of-concept prototypes that culminated in the more substantial HD-4, powered by Renault engines. A top speed of 54 miles per hour (87 km/h) was achieved, with the hydrofoil exhibiting rapid acceleration, good stability and steering along with the ability to take waves without difficulty. In 1913, Dr. Bell hired Walter Pinaud, a Sydney yacht designer and builder as well as the proprietor of Pinaud's Yacht Yard in Westmount, Nova Scotia to work on the pontoons of the HD-4. Pinaud soon took over the boatyard at Bell Laboratories on Beinn Bhreagh, Bell's estate near Baddeck, Nova Scotia. Pinaud's experience in boat-building enabled him to make useful design changes to the HD-4. After the First World War, work began again on the HD-4. Bell's report to the U.S. Navy permitted him to obtain two 350 horsepower (260 kilowatts) engines in July 1919. On September 9, 1919, the HD-4 set a world marine speed record of 70.86 miles per hour (114.04 kilometres per hour), a record which stood for ten years.\n\nQ: What did Baldwin liken the hydrofoil boat to?\n\nA: flying\n\nTitle: Franco-Prussian_War\n\nBackground: During the fighting, the Communards killed c.\u2009500 people, including the Archbishop of Paris, and burned down many government buildings, including the Tuileries Palace and the Hotel de Ville. Communards captured with weapons were routinely shot by the army and Government troops killed from 7,000\u201330,000 Communards in the fighting and in massacres of men, women, and children during and after the Commune. More recent histories, based on studies of the number buried in Paris cemeteries and in mass graves after the fall of the Commune, put the number killed at between 6,000 and 10,000. Twenty-six courts were established to try more than 40,000 people who had been arrested, which took until 1875 and imposed 95 death sentences, of which 23 were inflicted. Forced labour for life was imposed on 251 people, 1,160 people were transported to \"a fortified place\" and 3,417 people were transported. About 20,000 Communards were held in prison hulks until released in 1872 and a great many Communards fled abroad to England, Switzerland, Belgium or the United States. The survivors were amnestied by a bill introduced by Gambetta in 1880 and allowed to return.\n\nQ: What is the rough estimate of the number of people killed?\n\nA: between 6,000 and 10,000\n\nTitle: Biomass (ecology)\n\nBackground: ocean's primary producers are tiny phytoplankton that grow and reproduce rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, terrestrial primary producers grow and reproduce slowly. There is an exception with cyanobacteria. Marine cyanobacteria are the smallest known photosynthetic organisms; the smallest of all, \"Prochlorococcus\", is just 0.5 to 0.8 micrometres across. Prochlorococcus is possibly the most plentiful species on Earth: a single millilitre of surface seawater may contain 100,000 cells or more. Worldwide, there are estimated to be several octillion (~10) individuals. \"Prochlorococcus\" is ubiquitous between 40\u00b0N and 40\u00b0S and dominates in the\n\nQ: ['what cyanobacteria is thought to be the most abundant photosynthetic organism in the ocean?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Sino-Tibetan_relations_during_the_Ming_dynasty\n\nBackground: Soon after the victory in \u00dc-Tsang, G\u00fcshi Khan organized a welcoming ceremony for Lozang Gyatso once he arrived a day's ride from Shigatse, presenting his conquest of Tibet as a gift to the Dalai Lama. In a second ceremony held within the main hall of the Shigatse fortress, G\u00fcshi Khan enthroned the Dalai Lama as the ruler of Tibet, but conferred the actual governing authority to the regent Sonam Ch\u00f6pel. Although G\u00fcshi Khan had granted the Dalai Lama \"supreme authority\" as Goldstein writes, the title of 'King of Tibet' was conferred upon G\u00fcshi Khan, spending his summers in pastures north of Lhasa and occupying Lhasa each winter. Van Praag writes that at this point G\u00fcshi Khan maintained control over the armed forces, but accepted his inferior status towards the Dalai Lama. Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama shared power with his regent and G\u00fcshi Khan during his early secular and religious reign. However, Rawski states that he eventually \"expanded his own authority by presenting himself as Avalokite\u015bvara through the performance of rituals,\" by building the Potala Palace and other structures on traditional religious sites, and by emphasizing lineage reincarnation through written biographies. Goldstein states that the government of G\u00fcshi Khan and the Dalai Lama persecuted the Karma Kagyu sect, confiscated their wealth and property, and even converted their monasteries into Gelug monasteries. Rawski writes that this Mongol patronage allowed the Gelugpas to dominate the rival religious sects in Tibet.\n\nQ: The title of 'King of Tibet belonged to whom?\n\nA: G\u00fcshi Khan\n\nTitle: Oklahoma\n\nBackground: State law codifies Oklahoma's state emblems and honorary positions; the Oklahoma Senate or House of Representatives may adopt resolutions designating others for special events and to benefit organizations. Currently the State Senate is waiting to vote on a change to the state's motto. The House passed HCR 1024, which will change the state motto from \"Labor Omnia Vincit\" to \"Oklahoma-In God We Trust!\" The author of the resolution stated that a constituent researched the Oklahoma Constitution and found no \"official\" vote regarding \"Labor Omnia Vincit\", therefore opening the door for an entirely new motto.\n\nQ: What was Oklahoma's state motto, before the state House bill might change it?\n\nA: Labor Omnia Vincit\n\nTitle: High-density lipoprotein\n\nBackground: an alcohol. It is an essential structural component of cell membrane, where it is required to establish proper membrane permeability and fluidity. In addition, cholesterol is an important component for the manufacture of bile acids, steroid hormones, and vitamin D. Although cholesterol is an important and necessary molecule, a high level of serum cholesterol is an indicator for diseases such as heart disease.

Russia had assisted Austria's efforts in suppressing the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, and expected gratitude; it wanted a free hand in settling its problems with the Ottoman Empire \u2014 the \"sick man of Europe\".

During the Neolithic era, several predynastic cultures developed independently in Upper and Lower Egypt. The Badarian culture and the successor Naqada series are generally regarded as precursors to dynastic Egypt. The earliest known Lower Egyptian site, Merimda, predates the Badarian by about seven hundred years. Contemporaneous Lower Egyptian communities coexisted with their southern counterparts for more than two thousand years, remaining culturally distinct, but maintaining frequent contact through trade.

He continued to suffer doubt and, after a dream in 1773, believed that he was doomed to eternal damnation. He recovered and wrote more religious hymns. His religious sentiment and association with John Newton (who wrote the hymn \"Amazing Grace\") led to much of the poetry for which he is best remembered, and to the series of Olney Hymns. His poem \"Light Shining out of Darkness\" gave English the phrase: \"God moves in a mysterious way/His wonders to perform.\" He also wrote a number of anti-slavery poems and his friendship with Newton,\n\nQ: ['who wrote the hymn \"amazing grace\"?']\n\nA:",

Several hundred thousand square miles (several hundred thousand square kilometers) of the Great Plains have fewer than 6 inhabitants per square mile (2.3 inhabitants per square kilometer)\u2014the density standard Frederick Jackson Turner used to declare the American frontier \"closed\" in 1893. Many have fewer than 2 inhabitants per square mile (0.77 inhabitants per square kilometer). There are more than 6,000 ghost towns in the state of Kansas alone, according to Kansas historian Daniel Fitzgerald. This problem is often exacerbated by the consolidation of farms and the difficulty of attracting modern industry to the region. In addition, the smaller school-age population has forced the consolidation of school districts and the closure of high schools in some communities. The continuing population loss has led some to suggest that the current use of the drier parts of the Great Plains is not sustainable, and there has been a proposal - the \"Buffalo Commons\" - to return approximately 139,000 square miles (360,000 km2) of these drier parts to native prairie land.\n\nQ: how much prarie land does the \"Buffalo Commons\" want to return?\n\nA: 139,000 square miles\n\nTitle: Richard_Feynman\n\nBackground: Feynman was a keen popularizer of physics through both books and lectures, including a 1959 talk on top-down nanotechnology called There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, and the three-volume publication of his undergraduate lectures, The Feynman Lectures on Physics.

Cyprus was due to host the international art festival Manifesta in 2006 but this was cancelled at the last minute following a dispute between the Dutch organizers of Manifesta and the Cyprus Ministry of Education and Culture over the location of some of the Manifesta events in the Turkish sector of the capital Nicosia.\n\nQ: What types of places can Cypriots visit to experience art?\n\nA: Municipal art galleries\n\nTitle: Valencia\n\nBackground: On 9 July 2006, during Mass at Valencia's Cathedral, Our Lady of the Forsaken Basilica, Pope Benedict XVI used, at the World Day of Families, the Santo Caliz, a 1st-century Middle-Eastern artifact that some Catholics believe is the Holy Grail. It was supposedly brought to that church by Emperor Valerian in the 3rd century, after having been brought by St. Peter to Rome from Jerusalem. The Santo Caliz (Holy Chalice) is a simple, small stone cup. Its base was added in Medieval Times and consists of fine gold, alabaster and gem stones.\n\nQ: According to legend, who took the Santo Caliz to Rome?\n\nA: St. Peter\n\nTitle: Los Angeles International Airport\n\nBackground: designation for Los Angeles Airport. But with the rapid growth in the aviation industry the designations expanded to three letters c. 1947, and \"LA\" became \"LAX.\" The letter \"X\" has no specific meaning in this identifier (just like the X in DXB - Dubai). \"LAX\" is also used for the Port of Los Angeles in San Pedro and by Amtrak for Union Station in downtown Los Angeles. The \"Imperial Hill\" area (also known as Clutter's Park) in El Segundo is a prime location for aircraft spotting, especially for takeoffs.

He died while waiting for membership, and some of his followers became Mennonites. Thomas Helwys and others kept their baptism and their Baptist commitments. The modern Baptist denomination is an outgrowth of Smyth's movement. Baptists rejected the name Anabaptist when they were called that by opponents in derision.

With such progressively smaller circuits, more can be fitted on a computer chip. This allows faster and more complex functions using less power. Nanocircuits are composed of three different fundamental components. These are transistors, interconnections, and architecture, all fabricated on the nanometer scale. A variety of proposals have been made to implement nanocircuitry in different forms. These include Nanowires, Single-Electron Transistors, Quantum\n\nQ: ['what is a nanometer?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Department_store\n\nBackground: After World War II Hudson's realized that the limited parking space at its downtown skyscraper would increasingly be a problem for its customers. The solution in 1954 was to open the Northland Center in nearby Southfield, just beyond the city limits. It was the largest suburban shopping center in the world, and quickly became the main shopping destination for northern and western Detroit, and for much of the suburbs. By 1961 the downtown skyscraper accounted for only half of Hudson's sales; it closed in 1986. The Northland Center Hudson's, rebranded Macy's in 2006 following acquisition by Federated Department Stores, was closed along with the remaining stores in the center in March 2015 due to the mall's high storefront vacancy, decaying infrastructure, and financial mismanagement.\n\nQ: What company purchased the Northland Center in 2006?\n\nA: Federated Department Stores\n\nTitle: Infection\n\nBackground:  Among the vast varieties of microorganisms, relatively few cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals.

The appearance and severity of disease resulting from any pathogen, depends upon the ability of that pathogen to damage the host as well as the ability of the host to resist the pathogen. However a host's immune system can also cause damage to the host itself in an attempt to control the infection. Clinicians therefore classify infectious microorganisms or microbes according to the status of host defenses - either as primary pathogens or as opportunistic pathogens:\n\nQ: Of the huge amount of microorganisms, how many cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals?\n\nA: relatively few\n\nTitle: Neurodegeneration\n\nBackground: system.

The following paragraph is an excerpt from the Pathophysiology section of the article Parkinson's disease. The mechanism by which the brain cells in Parkinson's are lost \"may\" consist of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. The alpha-synuclein-ubiquitin complex cannot be directed to the proteasome. This protein accumulation forms proteinaceous cytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies.

After winning the bloody Battle of Prague on 6 May 1757, in which both forces suffered major casualties, the Prussians forced the Austrians back into the fortifications of Prague. The Prussian army then laid siege to the city. Following the battle at Prague, Frederick took 5,000 troops from the siege at Prague and sent them to reinforce the 19,000-man army under the Duke of Brunswick-Bevern at Kolin in Bohemia. Austrian Marshal Daun arrived too late to participate in the battle of Prague, but picked up 16,000 men who had escaped from the battle. With this army he slowly moved to relieve Prague. The Prussian army was too weak to simultaneously besiege Prague and keep Daun away, and Frederick was forced to attack prepared positions. The resulting Battle of Kolin was a sharp defeat for Frederick, his first military defeat. His losses further forced him to lift the siege and withdraw from Bohemia altogether.\n\nQ: What were casualties like in the 1757 battle in Prague?\n\nA: both forces suffered major casualties\n\nTitle: The_Blitz\n\nBackground: From the German point of view, March 1941 saw an improvement. The Luftwaffe flew 4,000 sorties that month, including 12 major and three heavy attacks. The electronic war intensified but the Luftwaffe flew major inland missions only on moonlit nights. Ports were easier to find and made better targets. To confuse the British, radio silence was observed until the bombs fell. X- and Y-Ger\u00e4t beams were placed over false targets and switched only at the last minute.

In 1885, Alexander III requested a new production of \"Eugene Onegin\" at the Bolshoi Kamenny Theatre in Saint Petersburg. By having the opera staged there and not at the Mariinsky Theatre, he served notice that Tchaikovsky's music was replacing Italian opera as the official imperial art. In addition, by virtue of Ivan Vsevolozhsky, Director of the Imperial Theaters and a patron of the composer, Tchaikovsky was awarded a lifetime annual pension of 3,000 rubles from the\n\nQ: ['who is the composer of eugene onegin?']\n\nA:",

The referendum turned out in favour of a continued association with France, largely due to a combined yes vote by the sizable Afar ethnic group and resident Europeans. There was also widespread vote rigging, with the French expelling thousands of Somalis before the referendum reached the polls. The majority of those who voted no were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia, as had been proposed by Mahmoud Harbi, Vice President of the Government Council. Harbi was killed in a plane crash two years later. Djibouti finally gained its independence from France in 1977, and Hassan Gouled Aptidon, a Somali who had campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum of 1958, eventually wound up as Djibouti's first president (1977\u20131991).\n\nQ: When did Djibouti achieve independence?\n\nA: 1977\n\nTitle: Doxepin\n\nBackground: was introduced under the brand names Quitaxon and Aponal by Boehringer, which discovered it, and as Sinequan by Pfizer, and has subsequently been marketed under many other names worldwide.

        "prompt": "Title: Late_Middle_Ages\n\nBackground: Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy, written in the early 14th century, merged a medieval world view with classical ideals. Another promoter of the Italian language was Boccaccio with his Decameron. The application of the vernacular did not entail a rejection of Latin, and both Dante and Boccaccio wrote prolifically in Latin as well as Italian, as would Petrarch later (whose Canzoniere also promoted the vernacular and whose contents are considered the first modern lyric poems). Together the three poets established the Tuscan dialect as the norm for the modern Italian language.\n\nQ: Which dialect became the norm for the modern Italian language?\n\nA: Tuscan\n\nTitle: Tucson,_Arizona\n\nBackground: The monsoon can begin any time from mid-June to late July, with an average start date around July 3. It typically continues through August and sometimes into September. During the monsoon, the humidity is much higher than the rest of the year. It begins with clouds building up from the south in the early afternoon followed by intense thunderstorms and rainfall, which can cause flash floods. The evening sky at this time of year is often pierced with dramatic lightning strikes. Large areas of the city do not have storm sewers, so monsoon rains flood the main thoroughfares, usually for no longer than a few hours. A few underpasses in Tucson have \"feet of water\" scales painted on their supports to discourage fording by automobiles during a rainstorm. Arizona traffic code Title 28-910, the so-called \"Stupid Motorist Law\", was instituted in 1995 to discourage people from entering flooded roadways. If the road is flooded and a barricade is in place, motorists who drive around the barricade can be charged up to $2000 for costs involved in rescuing them. Despite all warnings and precautions, however, three Tucson drivers have drowned between 2004 and 2010.\n\nQ: What could you say is the average start for a monsoon?\n\nA: July 3\n\nTitle: Kaanapali Airport\n\nBackground: Kaanapali Airport Kaanapali Airport was a small regional airport located on the northwest end of Maui, near the city of Lahaina and north of Kaanapali Beach in Honok\u014dwai. The airport serviced West Maui between 1965 and its closure in 1986. The exact date of the airport's construction is unknown, but was presumably built to transport workers to develop Kaanapali into a resort by Amfac, Inc. around 1961. It was not shown on the 1961 USGS topographic map. Royal Hawaiian Air Service was the only commuter airline authorized to use the airport, although Federal Express also used it.

Differentiation appears fully developed by mid-adolescence. Peaking in the 7th-9th grades, the personality traits adolescents use to describe themselves refer to specific contexts, and therefore may contradict one another. The recognition of inconsistent content in the self-concept is a common source of distress in these years (see Cognitive dissonance), but this distress may benefit adolescents by encouraging structural development.\n\nQ: Does the recognition of inconsistent content in one's self-concept typically bring distress or peace to an adolescent?\n\nA: distress\n\nTitle: Anthropology\n\nBackground: Archaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains.

        "prompt": "Title: Crimean_War\n\nBackground: The Treaty of Paris stood until 1871, when France was defeated by Prussia in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u20131871. While Prussia and several other German states united to form a powerful German Empire, the Emperor of the French, Napoleon III, was deposed to permit the formation of a Third French Republic. During his reign, Napoleon III, eager for the support of the United Kingdom, had opposed Russia over the Eastern Question. Russian interference in the Ottoman Empire, however, did not in any significant manner threaten the interests of France. Thus, France abandoned its opposition to Russia after the establishment of a republic. Encouraged by the decision of the French, and supported by the German minister Otto von Bismarck, Russia renounced the Black Sea clauses of the treaty agreed to in 1856. As the United Kingdom alone could not enforce the clauses, Russia once again established a fleet in the Black Sea.\n\nQ: Who renounced the Black Sea clause?\n\nA: Russia\n\nTitle: History_of_India\n\nBackground: In addition to the Vedas, the principal texts of Hinduism, the core themes of the Sanskrit epics Ramayana and Mahabharata are said to have their ultimate origins during this period. The Mahabharata remains, today, the longest single poem in the world. Historians formerly postulated an \"epic age\" as the milieu of these two epic poems, but now recognize that the texts (which are both familiar with each other) went through multiple stages of development over centuries. For instance, the Mahabharata may have been based on a small-scale conflict (possibly about 1000 BCE) which was eventually \"transformed into a gigantic epic war by bards and poets\". There is no conclusive proof from archaeology as to whether the specific events of the Mahabharat have any historical basis. The existing texts of these epics are believed to belong to the post-Vedic age, between c. 400 BCE and 400 CE. Some even attempted to date the events using methods of archaeoastronomy which have produced, depending on which passages are chosen and how they are interpreted, estimated dates ranging up to mid 2nd millennium BCE.\n\nQ: In what language were the Vedas ?\n\nA: Sanskrit\n\nTitle: Barbican tube station\n\nBackground: and Circle lines.

This system had its climax of deformation so long ago (probably in Permian time) that it has since then been very generally reduced to moderate or low relief. It owes its present-day altitude either to renewed elevations along the earlier lines or to the survival of the most resistant rocks as residual mountains. The oblique trend of this coast would be even more pronounced but for a comparatively modern crustal movement, causing a depression in the northeast resulting in an encroachment of the sea upon the land.

Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1 (1947), a case dealing with a New Jersey law that allowed government funds to pay for transportation of students to both public and Catholic schools. This was the first case in which the court applied the Establishment Clause to the laws of a state, having interpreted the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as applying the Bill of Rights to the states as well as the federal legislature.

        "prompt": "Title: Electric_motor\n\nBackground: Found in applications as diverse as industrial fans, blowers and pumps, machine tools, household appliances, power tools, and disk drives, electric motors can be powered by direct current (DC) sources, such as from batteries, motor vehicles or rectifiers, or by alternating current (AC) sources, such as from the power grid, inverters or generators. Small motors may be found in electric watches. General-purpose motors with highly standardized dimensions and characteristics provide convenient mechanical power for industrial use. The largest of electric motors are used for ship propulsion, pipeline compression and pumped-storage applications with ratings reaching 100 megawatts. Electric motors may be classified by electric power source type, internal construction, application, type of motion output, and so on.\n\nQ: What does AC stand for?\n\nA: alternating current\n\nTitle: Plymouth\n\nBackground: Plymouth railway station, which opened in 1877, is managed by Great Western Railway and also sees trains on the CrossCountry network. Smaller stations are served by local trains on the Tamar Valley Line and Cornish Main Line. First Great Western have come under fire recently, due to widespread rail service cuts across the south-west, which affect Plymouth greatly. Three MPs from the three main political parties in the region have lobbied that the train services are vital to its economy.\n\nQ: When did Plymouth's railroad station open for service?\n\nA: 1877\n\nTitle: Public university\n\nBackground: the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Rutgers University, and The University of Georgia, although the overall oldest university now designated as public is The College of William & Mary, which was founded by a Crown charter in 1693 and was originally a private institution. The University of South Carolina (1801) is the longest continuously supported public university; Ohio University (1804) is the oldest public university in continuous operation. Many U.S. public universities began as teacher training institutions and eventually were expanded into comprehensive universities. Examples include UCLA, formerly the southern branch of California State Normal School; Arizona State\n\nQ: ['what is the oldest university in the us?']\n\nA:",

A torr is equal to the displacement of a millimeter of mercury (mmHg) in a manometer with 1 torr equaling 133.3223684 pascals above absolute zero pressure. Vacuum is often also measured on the barometric scale or as a percentage of atmospheric pressure in bars or atmospheres. Low vacuum is often measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or pascals (Pa) below standard atmospheric pressure. \"Below atmospheric\" means that the absolute pressure is equal to the current atmospheric pressure.\n\nQ: Absolute pressure  being equal to current atmospheric pressure means what?\n\nA: \"Below atmospheric\"\n\nTitle: Pub\n\nBackground: The Licensing Act 2003, which came into force on 24 November 2005, consolidated the many laws into a single Act. This allowed pubs in England and Wales to apply to the local council for the opening hours of their choice. It was argued that this would end the concentration of violence around 11.30 pm, when people had to leave the pub, making policing easier. In practice, alcohol-related hospital admissions rose following the change in the law, with alcohol involved in 207,800 admissions in 2006/7. Critics claimed that these laws would lead to \"24-hour drinking\". By the time the law came into effect, 60,326 establishments had applied for longer hours and 1,121 had applied for a licence to sell alcohol 24 hours a day. However nine months later many pubs had not changed their hours, although some stayed open longer at the weekend, but rarely beyond 1:00 am.\n\nQ: Due to the traditional closing hours, when was there often violence outside of pubs?\n\nA: 11.30 pm\n\nTitle: Arthur M.

        "prompt": "Title: Religion_in_ancient_Rome\n\nBackground: In Rome, state cult to a living emperor acknowledged his rule as divinely approved and constitutional. As princeps (first citizen) he must respect traditional Republican mores; given virtually monarchic powers, he must restrain them. He was not a living divus but father of his country (pater patriae), its pontifex maximus (greatest priest) and at least notionally, its leading Republican. When he died, his ascent to heaven, or his descent to join the dii manes was decided by a vote in the Senate. As a divus, he could receive much the same honours as any other state deity \u2013 libations of wine, garlands, incense, hymns and sacrificial oxen at games and festivals. What he did in return for these favours is unknown, but literary hints and the later adoption of divus as a title for Christian Saints suggest him as a heavenly intercessor. In Rome, official cult to a living emperor was directed to his genius; a small number refused this honour and there is no evidence of any emperor receiving more than that. In the crises leading up to the Dominate, Imperial titles and honours multiplied, reaching a peak under Diocletian. Emperors before him had attempted to guarantee traditional cults as the core of Roman identity and well-being; refusal of cult undermined the state and was treasonous.\n\nQ: As a living divus, what was the emperor to Rome?\n\nA: father of his country\n\nTitle: Central_African_Republic\n\nBackground: Michel Djotodia took over as president and in May 2013 Central African Republic's Prime Minister Nicolas Tiangaye requested a UN peacekeeping force from the UN Security Council and on 31 May former President Boziz\u00e9 was indicted for crimes against humanity and incitement of genocide. The security situation did not improve during June\u2013August 2013 and there were reports of over 200,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) as well as human rights abuses and renewed fighting between S\u00e9l\u00e9ka and Boziz\u00e9 supporters.\n\nQ: What faction was fighting against the remaining Bozize loyalists?\n\nA: S\u00e9l\u00e9ka\n\nTitle: Sodium chloride\n\nBackground: used to produce glass, sodium bicarbonate, and dyes, as well as a myriad of other chemicals.

At the September 9, 2009 keynote presentation at the Apple Event, Phil Schiller announced total cumulative sales of iPods exceeded 220 million. The continual decline of iPod sales since 2009 has not been a surprising trend for the Apple corporation, as Apple CFO Peter Oppenheimer explained in June 2009: \"We expect our traditional MP3 players to decline over time as we cannibalize ourselves with the iPod Touch and the iPhone.\" Since 2009, the company's iPod sales have continually decreased every financial quarter and in 2013 a new model was not introduced onto the market.\n\nQ: How much revenue did iPod sales account for in Q4 2008?\n\nA: 14.21%\n\nTitle: Incandescent_light_bulb\n\nBackground: Since incandescent light bulbs use more energy than alternatives such as CFLs and LED lamps, many governments have introduced measures to ban their use, by setting minimum efficacy standards higher than can be achieved by incandescent lamps. Measures to ban light bulbs have been implemented in the European Union, the United States, Russia, Brazil, Argentina, Canada and Australia, among others. In the Europe the EC has calculated that the ban contributes 5 to 10 billion euros to the economy and saves 40 TWh of electricity every year, translating in CO2 emission reductions of 15 million tonnes.\n\nQ: How are laws written that bring about a ban of incandescent light bulbs?\n\nA: by setting minimum efficacy standards higher than can be achieved by incandescent lamps\n\nTitle: Moulin Rouge!\n\nBackground: Moulin Rouge! Moulin Rouge! (, from ) is a 2001 Australian-American jukebox musical romantic comedy film directed, co-produced, and co-written by Baz Luhrmann. It tells the story of a young English poet/writer, Christian (Ewan McGregor), who falls in love with the star of the Moulin Rouge, cabaret actress and courtesan Satine (Nicole Kidman). It uses the musical setting of the Montmartre Quarter of Paris, France. At the 74th Academy Awards, the film was nominated for eight Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actress for Nicole Kidman, winning two: for Best Art Direction and Best Costume Design.

        "prompt": "Title: History_of_India\n\nBackground: The Empire was established in 1336 by Harihara I and his brother Bukka Raya I of Sangama Dynasty. The empire rose to prominence as a culmination of attempts by the southern powers to ward off Islamic invasions by the end of the 13th century. The empire is named after its capital city of Vijayanagara, whose ruins surround present day Hampi, now a World Heritage Site in Karnataka, India. The empire's legacy includes many monuments spread over South India, the best known of which is the group at Hampi. The previous temple building traditions in South India came together in the Vijayanagara Architecture style. The mingling of all faiths and vernaculars inspired architectural innovation of Hindu temple construction, first in the Deccan and later in the Dravidian idioms using the local granite. South Indian mathematics flourished under the protection of the Vijayanagara Empire in Kerala. The south Indian mathematician Madhava of Sangamagrama founded the famous Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics in the 14th century which produced a lot of great south Indian mathematicians like Parameshvara, Nilakantha Somayaji and Jye\u1e63\u1e6dhadeva in medieval south India. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form. The Vijayanagara Empire created an epoch in South Indian history that transcended regionalism by promoting Hinduism as a unifying factor. The empire reached its peak during the rule of Sri Krishnadevaraya when Vijayanagara armies were consistently victorious. The empire annexed areas formerly under the Sultanates in the northern Deccan and the territories in the eastern Deccan, including Kalinga, while simultaneously maintaining control over all its subordinates in the south. Many important monuments were either completed or commissioned during the time of Krishna Deva Raya. Vijayanagara went into decline after the defeat in the Battle of Talikota (1565).\n\nQ: At what location are the best known monuments in the south of India?\n\nA: Hampi\n\nTitle: Multiracial_American\n\nBackground: The 2000 U.S. Census in the write-in response category had a code listing which standardizes the placement of various write-in responses for automatic placement within the framework of the U.S. Census's enumerated races. Whereas most responses can be distinguished as falling into one of the five enumerated races, there remains some write-in responses which fall into the \"Mixture\" heading which cannot be racially categorized. These include \"Bi Racial, Combination, Everything, Many, Mixed, Multi National, Multiple, Several and Various\".\n\nQ: What year did the US Census write in response category have a code-listing?\n\nA: 2000\n\nTitle: Kentucky River Palisades\n\nBackground: lithologies usually form gentle to moderate slopes. However, the Kentucky River Fault system, part of which runs along the Palisades provided another controlling factor. Movement along the fault was largely vertical. Strata on the north side of the fault were raised several hundred feet relative to those on the south side. The thick dolostones and limestones of the High Bridge Group (Tyrone, Oregon, and Camp Nelson formations) are resistant to erosion and tend to be cliff forming. As downward erosion hit the Camp Nelson Group rocks, meander-shaped cliffs were formed. Daniel Boone's Fort Boonesborough was sited close to the fault\n\nQ: ['what is the major fault line near kentucky?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Planck_constant\n\nBackground: First recognized in 1900 by Max Planck, it was originally the proportionality constant between the minimal increment of energy, E, of a hypothetical electrically charged oscillator in a cavity that contained black body radiation, and the frequency, f, of its associated electromagnetic wave. In 1905 the value E, the minimal energy increment of a hypothetical oscillator, was theoretically associated by Einstein with a \"quantum\" or minimal element of the energy of the electromagnetic wave itself. The light quantum behaved in some respects as an electrically neutral particle, as opposed to an electromagnetic wave. It was eventually called the photon.\n\nQ: Who discovered an association between the value E and quantum energy?\n\nA: Einstein\n\nTitle: Brain\n\nBackground: The oldest method of studying the brain is anatomical, and until the middle of the 20th century, much of the progress in neuroscience came from the development of better cell stains and better microscopes. Neuroanatomists study the large-scale structure of the brain as well as the microscopic structure of neurons and their components, especially synapses. Among other tools, they employ a plethora of stains that reveal neural structure, chemistry, and connectivity. In recent years, the development of immunostaining techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes. Also, functional neuroanatomy uses medical imaging techniques to correlate variations in human brain structure with differences in cognition or behavior.\n\nQ: What type of study uses medical imaging techniques to correlate changes in brain structure?\n\nA: neuroanatomy\n\nTitle: Languages in censuses\n\nBackground: single languages or language families. These categories represent the most commonly spoken languages other than English at home in the U.S. Due to small sample counts, data tabulations are not generally available for all 382 detailed languages. Instead, the Census Bureau collapses languages into smaller sets. These sets of languages were originally developed following the 1970 Census and are grouped linguistically and geographically. , the simplest collapse recodes the 382 language codes into four major language groups: Spanish; Other Indo-European languages; Asian and Pacific Island languages; and All Other languages.

In 1986, Aruba gained a \"status aparte\" and thereby left the Netherlands Antilles. Shortly after that, Aruba began to issue its own currency, the Aruban florin, which replaced the Netherlands Antillean guilder at par. In 2011, a year after the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles, Bonaire, Saba and Sint Eustatius switched to the US dollar. Cura\u00e7ao and Sint Maarten intended to replace the currency, thus ceased production of the currency, but as of still use the Antillean guilder. However since 2018 banknotes and coins now require replacement and there are only two years of the Antilles guilder physical currency\n\nQ: ['what currency can you use in aruba?']\n\nA:",

During the operation, the division and police conducted the Geochang massacre and Sancheong-Hamyang massacre. In mid-February, the PVA counterattacked with the Fourth Phase Offensive and achieved initial victory at Hoengseong. But the offensive was soon blunted by the IX Corps positions at Chipyong-ni in the center. Units of the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division and the French Battalion fought a short but desperate battle that broke the attack's momentum. The battle is sometimes known as the Gettysburg of the Korean War. The battle saw 5,600 Korean, American and French troops defeat a numerically superior Chinese force. Surrounded on all sides, the U.S. 2nd Infantry Division Warrior Division's 23rd Regimental Combat Team with an attached French Battalion was hemmed in by more than 25,000 Chinese Communist forces. United Nations forces had previously retreated in the face of large Communist forces instead of getting cut off, but this time they stood and fought at odds of roughly 15 to 1.\n\nQ: How many PVA soldiers fought in this battle and lost?\n\nA: more than 25,000\n\nTitle: Capital (Ethiopia)\n\nBackground: with necessary information.

The two sports have shared origins and are closely related but have significant differences. In particular, Canadian football has 12 players on the field per team rather than 11; the field is roughly 10 yards wider, and 10 yards longer between end-zones that are themselves 10 yards deeper; and a team has only three downs to gain 10 yards, which results in less offensive rushing than in the American game. In the Canadian game all players on the defending team, when a down begins, must be at least 1 yard from the line of scrimmage.

The giant mosaic, commissioned by Cardinal Jacopo Stefaneschi, was originally situated on the eastern porch of the old basilica and occupied the whole wall above the entrance arcade facing the courtyard. It depicted St. Peter walking on the waters. This extraordinary work was mainly destroyed during the construction of the new St. Peter's in the 17th century. Navicella means \"little ship\" referring to the large boat which dominated the scene, and whose sail, filled by the storm, loomed over the horizon.

        "prompt": "Title: Federalism\n\nBackground: Usually, a federation is formed at two levels: the central government and the regions (states, provinces, territories), and little to nothing is said about second or third level administrative political entities. Brazil is an exception, because the 1988 Constitution included the municipalities as autonomous political entities making the federation tripartite, encompassing the Union, the States, and the municipalities. Each state is divided into municipalities (munic\u00edpios) with their own legislative council (c\u00e2mara de vereadores) and a mayor (prefeito), which are partly autonomous from both Federal and State Government. Each municipality has a \"little constitution\", called \"organic law\" (lei org\u00e2nica). Mexico is an intermediate case, in that municipalities are granted full-autonomy by the federal constitution and their existence as autonomous entities (municipio libre, \"free municipality\") is established by the federal government and cannot be revoked by the states' constitutions. Moreover, the federal constitution determines which powers and competencies belong exclusively to the municipalities and not to the constituent states. However, municipalities do not have an elected legislative assembly.\n\nQ: What two levels equal a federation?\n\nA: the central government and the regions\n\nTitle: Apollo\n\nBackground: The cult centers of Apollo in Greece, Delphi and Delos, date from the 8th century BCE. The Delos sanctuary was primarily dedicated to Artemis, Apollo's twin sister. At Delphi, Apollo was venerated as the slayer of Pytho. For the Greeks, Apollo was all the Gods in one and through the centuries he acquired different functions which could originate from different gods. In archaic Greece he was the prophet, the oracular god who in older times was connected with \"healing\". In classical Greece he was the god of light and of music, but in popular religion he had a strong function to keep away evil. Walter Burkert discerned three components in the prehistory of Apollo worship, which he termed \"a Dorian-northwest Greek component, a Cretan-Minoan component, and a Syro-Hittite component.\"\n\nQ: Who discerned three components in the prehistory of Apollo worship?\n\nA: Walter Burkert\n\nTitle: Olympus Mons\n\nBackground: Olympus Mons Olympus Mons (; Latin for Mount Olympus) is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars. The volcano has a height of nearly 25 km (13.6 mi or 72,000 ft) as measured by the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA). Olympus Mons is about two and a half times Mount Everest's height above sea level.

Red was also the color associated with army; Roman soldiers wore red tunics, and officers wore a cloak called a paludamentum which, depending upon the quality of the dye, could be crimson, scarlet or purple. In Roman mythology red is associated with the god of war, Mars. The vexilloid of the Roman Empire had a red background with the letters SPQR in gold.

        "prompt": "Title: Switzerland\n\nBackground: In 2002 Switzerland became a full member of the United Nations, leaving the Vatican City as the last widely recognised state without full UN membership. Switzerland is a founding member of the EFTA, but is not a member of the European Economic Area. An application for membership in the European Union was sent in May 1992, but not advanced since the EEA was rejected in December 1992 when Switzerland was the only country to launch a referendum on the EEA. There have since been several referenda on the EU issue; due to a mixed reaction from the population the membership application has been frozen. Nonetheless, Swiss law is gradually being adjusted to conform with that of the EU, and the government has signed a number of bilateral agreements with the European Union. Switzerland, together with Liechtenstein, has been completely surrounded by the EU since Austria's entry in 1995. On 5 June 2005, Swiss voters agreed by a 55% majority to join the Schengen treaty, a result that was regarded by EU commentators as a sign of support by Switzerland, a country that is traditionally perceived as independent and reluctant to enter supranational bodies.\n\nQ: What did Swiss voters agree to join on June 5, 2005?\n\nA: Schengen treaty\n\nTitle: England_national_football_team\n\nBackground: Their first ever defeat on home soil to a foreign team was an 0\u20132 loss to the Republic of Ireland, on 21 September 1949 at Goodison Park. A 6\u20133 loss in 1953 to Hungary, was their second defeat by a foreign team at Wembley. In the return match in Budapest, Hungary won 7\u20131. This still stands as England's worst ever defeat. After the game, a bewildered Syd Owen said, \"it was like playing men from outer space\". In the 1954 FIFA World Cup, England reached the quarter-finals for the first time, and lost 4\u20132 to reigning champions Uruguay.\n\nQ: To whom is the quote \"it was like playing men from outer space\" attributed?\n\nA: Syd Owen\n\nTitle: Rheumatoid arthritis\n\nBackground: erosion of the joint surface causing deformity and loss of function. RA typically manifests with signs of inflammation, with the affected joints being swollen, warm, painful and stiff, particularly early in the morning on waking or following prolonged inactivity. Increased stiffness early in the morning is often a prominent feature of the disease and typically lasts for more than an hour. Gentle movements may relieve symptoms in early stages of the disease. These signs help distinguish rheumatoid from non-inflammatory problems of the joints, such as osteoarthritis. In arthritis of non-inflammatory causes, signs of inflammation and early morning stiffness are less\n\nQ: ['what is rheumatoid arthritis?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Insect\n\nBackground: Camouflage is an important defense strategy, which involves the use of coloration or shape to blend into the surrounding environment. This sort of protective coloration is common and widespread among beetle families, especially those that feed on wood or vegetation, such as many of the leaf beetles (family Chrysomelidae) or weevils. In some of these species, sculpturing or various colored scales or hairs cause the beetle to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects. Many of those that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of the substrate. Most phasmids are known for effectively replicating the forms of sticks and leaves, and the bodies of some species (such as O. macklotti and Palophus centaurus) are covered in mossy or lichenous outgrowths that supplement their disguise. Some species have the ability to change color as their surroundings shift (B. scabrinota, T. californica). In a further behavioral adaptation to supplement crypsis, a number of species have been noted to perform a rocking motion where the body is swayed from side to side that is thought to reflect the movement of leaves or twigs swaying in the breeze. Another method by which stick insects avoid predation and resemble twigs is by feigning death (catalepsy), where the insect enters a motionless state that can be maintained for a long period. The nocturnal feeding habits of adults also aids Phasmatodea in remaining concealed from predators.\n\nQ: What does coloration and shape help an insect do in the surrounding environment?\n\nA: blend\n\nTitle: Pharmaceutical_industry\n\nBackground: While highly effective, the requirement for injection limited the use of norepinephrine[clarification needed] and orally active derivatives were sought. A structurally similar compound, ephedrine, was identified by Japanese chemists in the Ma Huang plant and marketed by Eli Lilly as an oral treatment for asthma. Following the work of Henry Dale and George Barger at Burroughs-Wellcome, academic chemist Gordon Alles synthesized amphetamine and tested it in asthma patients in 1929. The drug proved to have only modest anti-asthma effects, but produced sensations of exhilaration and palpitations. Amphetamine was developed by Smith, Kline and French as a nasal decongestant under the trade name Benzedrine Inhaler. Amphetamine was eventually developed for the treatment of narcolepsy, post-encepheletic parkinsonism, and mood elevation in depression and other psychiatric indications. It received approval as a New and Nonofficial Remedy from the American Medical Association for these uses in 1937 and remained in common use for depression until the development of tricyclic antidepressants in the 1960s.\n\nQ: When were tricyclic antidepressants developed?\n\nA: 1960s\n\nTitle: The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)\n\nBackground: at auction with the rest of her collections by owner actress Debbie Reynolds for $510,000 (not including the buyer's premium) in June 2011. The Wizard of Oz (1939 film) The Wizard of Oz is a 1939 American musical fantasy film produced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Widely considered to be one of the greatest films in cinema history, it is the best-known and most commercially successful adaptation of L. Frank Baum's 1900 children's book \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\" It was directed primarily by Victor Fleming (who left production to take over direction on the troubled \"Gone with the Wind\" production).

The program originally began in 1958, with a \"Gold Award\" for singles and albums that reach $1,000,000 in sales. The criterion was changed in 1975 to the number of copies sold, with albums selling 500,000 copies awarded the Gold Award. In 1976, a \"Platinum Award\" was added for one million sales. In 1989 new criteria were introduced, with a \"Gold Award\" for singles that reach 500,000 in sales and a \"Platinum Award\" for singles that reach 1,000,000 in sales; and in 1999 a \"Diamond Award\" for ten million sales was introduced. The awards are open to both RIAA members\n\nQ: ['how many copies of an album must be sold for it to be a gold album?']\n\nA:",

Reconciling patents and universal access to medicine would require an efficient international policy of price discrimination. Moreover, under the TRIPS agreement of the World Trade Organization, countries must allow pharmaceutical products to be patented. In 2001, the WTO adopted the Doha Declaration, which indicates that the TRIPS agreement should be read with the goals of public health in mind, and allows some methods for circumventing pharmaceutical monopolies: via compulsory licensing or parallel imports, even before patent expiration.\n\nQ: Who adopted the Doha Declaration?\n\nA: World Trade Organization\n\nTitle: Somalis\n\nBackground: An Ancient Chinese document from the 9th century referred to the northern Somali coast \u2014 which was then called \"Berbera\" by Arab geographers in reference to the region's \"Berber\" (Cushitic) inhabitants \u2014 as Po-pa-li. The first clear written reference of the sobriquet Somali, however, dates back to the 15th century. During the wars between the Sultanate of Ifat based at Zeila and the Solomonic Dynasty, the Abyssinian Emperor had one of his court officials compose a hymn celebrating a military victory over the Sultan of Ifat's eponymous troops.\n\nQ: In what century was the term 'Somali' first used?\n\nA: 15th\n\nTitle: Blue baby syndrome\n\nBackground: simultaneously into the two bottom chambers, or ventricles.

Following this lead, the Bauhaus school, founded in Weimar, Germany in 1919, redefined the architectural bounds prior set throughout history, viewing the creation of a building as the ultimate synthesis\u2014the apex\u2014of art, craft, and technology.\n\nQ: What new type of architecture was starting to come into being at this time?\n\nA: Modern Architecture\n\nTitle: American Idol (season 3)\n\nBackground: American Idol (season 3) The third season of American Idol premiered on Monday, January 19, 2004 and continued until May 26, 2004.

        "prompt": "Title: Slavs\n\nBackground: The Slavic autonym is reconstructed in Proto-Slavic as *Slov\u011bnin\u044a, plural *Slov\u011bne. The oldest documents written in Old Church Slavonic and dating from the 9th century attest \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0463\u043d\u0435 Slov\u011bne to describe the Slavs. Other early Slavic attestations include Old East Slavic \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0463\u043d\u0463 Slov\u011bn\u011b for \"an East Slavic group near Novgorod.\" However, the earliest written references to the Slavs under this name are in other languages. In the 6th century AD Procopius, writing in Byzantine Greek, refers to the \u03a3\u03ba\u03bb\u03ac\u03b2\u03bf\u03b9 Sklaboi, \u03a3\u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03af Sklab\u0113noi, \u03a3\u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u03c5\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03af Sklauenoi, \u03a3\u03b8\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03af Sthlabenoi, or \u03a3\u03ba\u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u1fd6\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 Sklabinoi, while his contemporary Jordanes refers to the Sclaveni in Latin.\n\nQ: Who wrote about the Slavs in Byzantine Greek in the 6th century?\n\nA: Procopius\n\nTitle: Age_of_Enlightenment\n\nBackground: The Enlightenment has always been contested territory. Its supporters \"hail it as the source of everything that is progressive about the modern world.

From the start there was a Counter-Enlightenment in which conservative and clerical defenders of traditional religion attacked materialism and skepticism as evil forces that encouraged immorality. By 1794, they pointed to the Terror during the French Revolution as confirmation of their predictions. As the Enlightenment was ending, Romantic philosophers argued that excessive dependence on reason was a mistake perpetuated by the Enlightenment, because it disregarded the bonds of history, myth, faith and tradition that were necessary to hold society together.\n\nQ: Which type of philosophers argued that excessive dependence on reason was a mistake perpetuated by the Enlightenment?\n\nA: Romantic\n\nTitle: Susan B.

Eritrea was to have its own administrative and judicial structure, its own flag, and control over its domestic affairs, including police, local administration, and taxation. The federal government, which for all intents and purposes was the existing imperial government, was to control foreign affairs (including commerce), defense, finance, and transportation. The resolution ignored the wishes of Eritreans for independence, but guaranteed the population democratic rights and a measure of autonomy.\n\nQ: What would federal government control in Eritrea according to Resolution 390A(V)??\n\nA: foreign affairs (including commerce), defense, finance, and transportation\n\nTitle: United_States_Army\n\nBackground: Following their basic and advanced training at the individual-level, soldiers may choose to continue their training and apply for an \"additional skill identifier\" (ASI). The ASI allows the army to take a wide ranging MOS and focus it into a more specific MOS. For example, a combat medic, whose duties are to provide pre-hospital emergency treatment, may receive ASI training to become a cardiovascular specialist, a dialysis specialist, or even a licensed practical nurse. For commissioned officers, ASI training includes pre-commissioning training either at USMA, or via ROTC, or by completing OCS. After commissioning, officers undergo branch specific training at the Basic Officer Leaders Course, (formerly called Officer Basic Course), which varies in time and location according their future assignments. Further career development is available through the Army Correspondence Course Program.\n\nQ: If the officers want to advance their careers even further, where is that available?\n\nA: Army Correspondence Course Program\n\nTitle: Edmonton (electoral district)\n\nBackground: immigrants, and when Alberta joined Confederation as a province in 1905. By-election: On Mr. Oliver being appointed Minister of Interior, 8 April 1905 Edmonton (electoral district) Edmonton was a federal electoral district represented in the House of Commons of Canada. It was located initially in the Northwest Territories, and following its creation in 1905, the province of Alberta (although between 1905 and 1907 Edmonton also included parts of Saskatchewan). This riding was created in 1903, and was abolished in 1914 when it was redistributed into Edmonton East, Edmonton West and Strathcona ridings.

        "prompt": "Title: Predation\n\nBackground: Predatory animals often use their usual methods of attacking prey to inflict or to threaten grievous injury to their own predators. The electric eel uses the same electric current to kill prey and to defend itself against animals (anacondas, caimans, egrets, jaguars, mountain lions, giant otters, humans, dogs, and cats) that ordinarily prey upon fish similar to an electric eel in size; the electric eel thus remains an apex predator in a predator-rich environment. A predator small enough to be prey for others, the domestic cat uses its formidable teeth and claws as weapons against animals that might confuse a cat with easier prey. Many non-predatory prey animals, such as a zebra, can give a strong kick that can maim or kill, while others charge with tusks or horns.\n\nQ: What defenses does a domestic cat have against predators?\n\nA: formidable teeth and claws\n\nTitle: Pope_Paul_VI\n\nBackground: In 1916, he entered the seminary to become a Roman Catholic priest.

Montini concluded his studies in Milan with a doctorate in Canon Law in the same year. Afterwards he studied at the Gregorian University, the University of Rome La Sapienza and, at the request of Giuseppe Pizzardo at the Accademia dei Nobili Ecclesiastici. At the age of twenty-five, again at the request of Giuseppe Pizzardo, Montini entered the Secretariat of State in 1922, where he worked under Pizzardo together with Francesco Borgongini-Duca, Alfredo Ottaviani, Carlo Grano, Domenico Tardini and Francis Spellman. Consequently, he spent not a day as a parish priest. In 1925 he helped found the publishing house Morcelliana in Brescia, focused on promoting a 'Christian inspired culture'.\n\nQ: In what field did Montini obtain a doctorate in?\n\nA: Canon Law\n\nTitle: Eurostar\n\nBackground: stock and is quite busy; a proposed cut-off bypassing Lille, which would reduce Eurostar journey times to Paris, is called LGV Picardie.

Tunnelling began in 1988, and the tunnel was officially opened by the British sovereign Queen Elizabeth II and the French President Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand at a ceremony in Calais on 6 May 1994.

        "prompt": "Title: Pharmaceutical_industry\n\nBackground: During the years 1940-1955, the rate of decline in the U.S. death rate accelerated from 2% per year to 8% per year, then returned to the historical rate of 2% per year. The dramatic decline in the immediate post-war years has been attributed to the rapid development of new treatments and vaccines for infectious disease that occurred during these years. Vaccine development continued to accelerate, with the most notable achievement of the period being Jonas Salk's 1954 development of the polio vaccine under the funding of the non-profit National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. The vaccine process was never patented, but was instead given to pharmaceutical companies to manufacture as a low-cost generic. In 1960 Maurice Hilleman of Merck Sharp & Dohme identified the SV40 virus, which was later shown to cause tumors in many mammalian species. It was later determined that SV40 was present as a contaminant in polio vaccine lots that had been administered to 90% of the children in the United States. The contamination appears to have originated both in the original cell stock and in monkey tissue used for production. In 2004 the United States Cancer Institute announced that it had concluded that SV40 is not associated with cancer in people.\n\nQ: Who created the polio vaccine?\n\nA: Jonas Salk\n\nTitle: Quran\n\nBackground: One of the notable authors of esoteric interpretation prior to the 12th century is Sulami (d. 1021) without whose work the majority of very early Sufi commentaries would not have been preserved. Sulami's major commentary is a book named haqaiq al-tafsir (\"Truths of Exegesis\") which is a compilation of commentaries of earlier Sufis. From the 11th century onwards several other works appear, including commentaries by Qushayri (d. 1074), Daylami (d. 1193), Shirazi (d. 1209) and Suhrawardi (d. 1234). These works include material from Sulami's books plus the author's contributions. Many works are written in Persian such as the works of Maybudi (d. 1135) kash al-asrar (\"the unveiling of the secrets\"). Rumi (d. 1273) wrote a vast amount of mystical poetry in his book Mathnawi. Rumi makes heavy use of the Quran in his poetry, a feature that is sometimes omitted in translations of Rumi's work. A large number of Quranic passages can be found in Mathnawi, which some consider a kind of Sufi interpretation of the Quran. Rumi's book is not exceptional for containing citations from and elaboration on the Quran, however, Rumi does mention Quran more frequently. Simnani (d. 1336) wrote two influential works of esoteric exegesis on the Quran. He reconciled notions of God's manifestation through and in the physical world with the sentiments of Sunni Islam. Comprehensive Sufi commentaries appear in the 18th century such as the work of Ismail Hakki Bursevi (d. 1725). His work ruh al-Bayan (the Spirit of Elucidation) is a voluminous exegesis. Written in Arabic, it combines the author's own ideas with those of his predecessors (notably Ibn Arabi and Ghazali), all woven together in Hafiz, a Persian poetry form.\n\nQ: What is the English name of Sulami's major work?\n\nA: Truths of Exegesis\n\nTitle: Madonna (entertainer)\n\nBackground: version of \"A Chorus Line\" using her birth-name of Ciccone, but he rejected her.

She also played the title role in the 1985 comedy \"Desperately Seeking Susan\", a film which introduced the song \"Into the Groove\", her first number-one single in the UK.

        "prompt": "Title: Gamal_Abdel_Nasser\n\nBackground: In 1937, Nasser applied to the Royal Military Academy for army officer training, but his police record of anti-government protest initially blocked his entry. Disappointed, he enrolled in the law school at King Fuad University, but quit after one semester to reapply to the Military Academy. From his readings, Nasser, who frequently spoke of \"dignity, glory, and freedom\" in his youth, became enchanted with the stories of national liberators and heroic conquerors; a military career became his chief priority.\n\nQ: Why was Nasser rejected from the Academy?\n\nA: record of anti-government protest\n\nTitle: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric_Chopin\n\nBackground: In the spring of 1834, Chopin attended the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in Aix-la-Chapelle with Hiller, and it was there that Chopin met Felix Mendelssohn. After the festival, the three visited D\u00fcsseldorf, where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn described as \"a very agreeable day\", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as Lessing, Bendemann, Hildebrandt and Sohn. In 1835 Chopin went to Carlsbad, where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzi\u0144skis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter Maria in Poland five years earlier, when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via Leipzig. The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses. In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, Clara Wieck and Felix Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio St. Paul, and who considered him \"a perfect musician\". In July 1836 Chopin travelled to Marienbad and Dresden to be with the Wodzi\u0144ski family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzi\u0144ska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his G minor Ballade. At the end of 1836 he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1. The anodyne thanks he received from Maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her.\n\nQ: Who did Chopin meet at a music festival early in 1834?\n\nA: Felix Mendelssohn\n\nTitle: Aellopos clavipes\n\nBackground: Aellopos clavipes Aellopos clavipes, also known as the clavipes sphinx, is a moth of the family Sphingidae.

These norms, unlike other principles of customary law, are recognized as permitting no violations and so cannot be altered through treaty obligations. These are limited to such universally accepted prohibitions as those against the aggressive use of force, genocide and other crimes against humanity, piracy, hostilities directed at civilian population, racial discrimination and apartheid, slavery and torture, meaning that no state can legally assume an obligation to commit or permit such acts.\n\nQ: What will a treaty be if it is in violation of a peremptory norm?\n\nA: null and void\n\nTitle: Nanjing\n\nBackground: Nanjing Library, founded in 1907, houses more than 10 million volumes of printed materials and is the third largest library in China, after the National Library in Beijing and Shanghai Library.

Satisfied with this appointment, the Soviet authorities were more conciliatory with Romania. On 13 March 1945 Moscow transferd the administration of Transylvania to Bucharest. A few months later, on 19 July 1945, Michael I was decorated with the Order of Victory, one of the most prestigious Soviet military orders.

It was fought about 6 miles (9.7 km) west of Metz, where on the previous day, having intercepted the French army's retreat to the west at the Battle of Mars-La-Tour, the Prussians were now closing in to complete the destruction of the French forces. The combined German forces, under Field Marshal Count Helmuth von Moltke, were the Prussian First and Second Armies of the North German Confederation numbering about 210 infantry battalions, 133 cavalry squadrons, and 732 heavy cannons totaling 188,332 officers and men.

        "prompt": "Title: House_music\n\nBackground: The term \"house music\" is said to have originated from a Chicago club called The Warehouse, which existed from 1977 to 1983. Clubbers to The Warehouse were primarily black and gay, who came to dance to music played by the club's resident DJ Frankie Knuckles, whom fans refer to as the \"godfather of house\". After the Warehouse closed in 1983, the crowds went to Knuckles' new club, The Power Plant. In the Channel 4 documentary Pump Up The Volume, Knuckles remarks that the first time he heard the term \"house music\" was upon seeing \"we play house music\" on a sign in the window of a bar on Chicago's South Side. One of the people in the car with him joked, \"you know, that's the kind of music you play down at the Warehouse!\", and then everybody laughed. South-Side Chicago DJ Leonard \"Remix\" Roy, in self-published statements, claims he put such a sign in a tavern window because it was where he played music that one might find in one's home; in his case, it referred to his mother's soul & disco records, which he worked into his sets. Farley Jackmaster Funk was quoted as saying \"In 1982, I was DJing at a club called The Playground and there was this kid named Leonard 'Remix' Roy who was a DJ at a rival club called The Rink. He came over to my club one night, and into the DJ booth and said to me, 'I've got the gimmick that's gonna take all the people out of your club and into mine \u2013 it's called House music.'

The highly leveraged nature of its business led the bank to request security from the Bank of England. This in turn led to investor panic and a bank run in mid-September 2007. Calls by Liberal Democrat Treasury Spokesman Vince Cable to nationalise the institution were initially ignored; in February 2008, however, the British government (having failed to find a private sector buyer) relented, and the bank was taken into public hands. Northern Rock's problems proved to be an early indication of the troubles that would soon befall other banks and financial institutions.\n\nQ: When did Northern Rock investors panic and a bank run begin?\n\nA: September 2007\n\nTitle: La Palma\n\nBackground: the Canary Island archipelago, is a volcanic ocean island.

In 1819 the island of Funafuti was named Ellice's Island; the name Ellice was applied to all nine islands after the work of English hydrographer Alexander George Findlay. The islands came under Britain's sphere of influence in the late 19th century, when each of the Ellice Islands was declared a British Protectorate by Captain Gibson of HMS Curacoa between 9 and 16 October 1892. The Ellice Islands were administered as British protectorate by a Resident Commissioner from 1892 to 1916 as part of the British Western Pacific Territories (BWPT), and then as part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony from 1916 to 1974.\n\nQ: Who was the discoverer of Tuvalu?\n\nA: \u00c1lvaro de Menda\u00f1a\n\nTitle: Chihuahua_(state)\n\nBackground: The earliest evidence of human inhabitants of modern day Chihuahua was discovered in the area of Samalayuca and Rancho Colorado.

It is common to speak of an entire species of bacteria as pathogenic when it is identified as the cause of a disease \"(cf. Koch's postulates)\". However, the modern view is that pathogenicity depends on the microbial ecosystem as a whole.

        "prompt": "Title: Cyprus\n\nBackground: In January 1950, the Church of Cyprus organised a referendum under the supervision of clerics and with no Turkish Cypriot participation, where 96% of the participating Greek Cypriots voted in favour of enosis, The Greeks were 80.2% of the total island' s population at the time (census 1946). Restricted autonomy under a constitution was proposed by the British administration but eventually rejected. In 1955 the EOKA organisation was founded, seeking union with Greece through armed struggle. At the same time the Turkish Resistance Organisation (TMT), calling for Taksim, or partition, was established by the Turkish Cypriots as a counterweight. The British had also adopted at the time a policy of \"divide and rule\". Woodhouse, a British official in Cyprus, revealed that then British Foreign Secretary Harold Macmillan \"urged the Britons in Cyprus to stir up the Turks in order to neutralise Greek agitation\". British officials also tolerated the creation of the Turkish underground organisation T.M.T. The Secretary of State for the Colonies in a letter dated 15 July 1958 had advised the Governor of Cyprus not to act against T.M.T despite its illegal actions so as not to harm British relations with the Turkish government.\n\nQ: In what year did the Church of Cyprus organize a referendum?\n\nA: 1950\n\nTitle: On_the_Origin_of_Species\n\nBackground: Chapter I covers animal husbandry and plant breeding, going back to ancient Egypt. Darwin discusses contemporary opinions on the origins of different breeds under cultivation to argue that many have been produced from common ancestors by selective breeding. As an illustration of artificial selection, he describes fancy pigeon breeding, noting that \"[t]he diversity of the breeds is something astonishing\", yet all were descended from one species of rock pigeon. Darwin saw two distinct kinds of variation: (1) rare abrupt changes he called \"sports\" or \"monstrosities\" (example: ancon sheep with short legs), and (2) ubiquitous small differences (example: slightly shorter or longer bill of pigeons). Both types of hereditary changes can be used by breeders. However, for Darwin the small changes were most important in evolution.\n\nQ: Which evolutionary changes were the most important to Darwin?\n\nA: the small changes\n\nTitle: Today (Elvis Presley album)\n\nBackground: time Presley would record in a studio. He last recorded at Studio C, Hollywood in 1972 where he recorded the gold records \"Burning Love\" and \"Separate Ways\". At this time, Elvis was 40 years old. He was accompanied by his then-current girlfriend, Sheila Ryan. In the 2005 FTD TODAY release from these sessions, Presley asked her to \"step up here Sheila, let me sing to ya baby\" on Take 1 of Don McLean's \"And I Love You So\". He continued to make \"And I Love You So\" and \"Fairytale\" a part of his live concerts until his death. On stage,\n\nQ: ['how old was elvis presley when he died?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Melbourne\n\nBackground: In May and June 1835, the area which is now central and northern Melbourne was explored by John Batman, a leading member of the Port Phillip Association in Van Diemen's Land (now known as Tasmania), who claimed to have negotiated a purchase of 600,000 acres (2,400 km2) with eight Wurundjeri elders. Batman selected a site on the northern bank of the Yarra River, declaring that \"this will be the place for a village\". Batman then returned to Launceston in Tasmania. In early August 1835 a different group of settlers, including John Pascoe Fawkner, left Launceston on the ship Enterprize. Fawkner was forced to disembark at Georgetown, Tasmania, because of outstanding debts. The remainder of the party continued and arrived at the mouth of the Yarra River on 15 August 1835. On 30 August 1835 the party disembarked and established a settlement at the site of the current Melbourne Immigration Museum. Batman and his group arrived on 2 September 1835 and the two groups ultimately agreed to share the settlement.\n\nQ: Tasmania was formerly known as what?\n\nA: Van Diemen's Land\n\nTitle: Hyderabad\n\nBackground: When the GHMC was created in 2007, the area occupied by the municipality increased from 175 km2 (68 sq mi) to 650 km2 (250 sq mi). Consequently, the population increased by 87%, from 3,637,483 in the 2001 census to 6,809,970 in the 2011 census, 24% of which are migrants from elsewhere in India,:2 making Hyderabad the nation's fourth most populous city. As of 2011[update], the population density is 18,480/km2 (47,900/sq mi). At the same 2011 census, the Hyderabad Urban Agglomeration had a population of 7,749,334, making it the sixth most populous urban agglomeration in the country. The population of the Hyderabad urban agglomeration has since been estimated by electoral officials to be 9.1 million as of early 2013 but is expected to exceed 10 million by the end of the year. There are 3,500,802 male and 3,309,168 female citizens\u2014a sex ratio of 945 females per 1000 males, higher than the national average of 926 per 1000. Among children aged 0\u20136 years, 373,794 are boys and 352,022 are girls\u2014a ratio of 942 per 1000. Literacy stands at 82.96% (male 85.96%; female 79.79%), higher than the national average of 74.04%.

        "prompt": "Title: Dialect\n\nBackground: There is no universally accepted criterion for distinguishing two different languages from two dialects (i.e. varieties) of the same language. A number of rough measures exist, sometimes leading to contradictory results. The distinction is therefore subjective and depends on the user's frame of reference. For example, there is discussion about if the Lim\u00f3n Creole English must be considered as \"a kind\" of English or a different language. This creole is spoken in the Caribbean coast of Costa Rica (Central America) by descendant of Jamaican people. The position that Costa Rican linguists support depends on the University they belong.\n\nQ: In what country is Lim\u00f3n Creole English spoken?\n\nA: Costa Rica\n\nTitle: Red\n\nBackground: Red was the color of the banner of the Byzantine emperors. In Western Europe, Emperor Charlemagne painted his palace red as a very visible symbol of his authority, and wore red shoes at his coronation. Kings, princes and, beginning in 1295, Roman Catholic cardinals began to wear red costumes. When Abbe Suger rebuilt Saint Denis Basilica outside Paris in the early 12th century, he added stained glass windows colored blue cobalt glass and red glass tinted with copper. Together they flooded the basilica with a mystical light. Soon stained glass windows were being added to cathedrals all across France, England and Germany. In Medieval painting red was used to attract attention to the most important figures; both Christ and the Virgin Mary were commonly painted wearing red mantles.\n\nQ: Christ and which other Christian figure were often painted red in medieval painting?\n\nA: Virgin Mary\n\nTitle: Vietnam War\n\nBackground: by the U.S. Congress.

Some 275,000\u2013310,000 Cambodians, 20,000\u201362,000 Laotians, and 58,220 U.S. service members also died in the conflict, and a further 1,626 remain missing in action.

In debate in Parliament on Britain's relations with Russia, Fox praised the principles of the revolution, although Burke was not able to reply at this time as he was \"overpowered by continued cries of question from his own side of the House\". When Parliament was debating the Quebec Bill for a constitution for Canada, Fox praised the revolution and criticised some of Burke's arguments, such as hereditary power. On 6 May 1791, during another debate in Parliament on the Quebec Bill, Burke used the opportunity to answer Fox, and to condemn the new French Constitution and \"the horrible consequences flowing from the French idea of the Rights of Man\". Burke asserted that those ideas were the antithesis of both the British and the American constitutions. Burke was interrupted, and Fox intervened, saying that Burke should be allowed to carry on with his speech. A vote of censure was moved against Burke, however, for noticing the affairs of France, which was moved by Lord Sheffield and seconded by Fox. Pitt made a speech praising Burke, and Fox made a speech\u2014both rebuking and complimenting Burke. He questioned the sincerity of Burke, who seemed to have forgotten the lessons he had learned from him, quoting from Burke's own speeches of fourteen and fifteen years before.\n\nQ: Fox praised revolutionary principles in a debate about which country?\n\nA: Russia\n\nTitle: Bovine somatotropin\n\nBackground: profit of $15.88 US per cow on average by using bST. Bovine somatotropin Bovine somatotropin or bovine somatotrophin (abbreviated bST and BST), or bovine growth hormone (BGH), is a peptide hormone produced by cows' pituitary glands. Like other hormones, it is produced in small quantities and is used in regulating metabolic processes. After the biotech company Genentech discovered and patented the gene for BST in the 1970s, it became possible to synthesize the hormone using recombinant DNA technology to create recombinant bovine somatotropin (rBST), recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH), or artificial growth hormone.

Brodsky, purchased American Cable Systems as a corporate spin-off from its parent, Jerrold Electronics, for US $500,000. At the time, American Cable was a small cable operator in Tupelo, Mississippi, with five channels and 12,000 customers.

        "prompt": "Title: Printed_circuit_board\n\nBackground: Cordwood construction can save significant space and was often used with wire-ended components in applications where space was at a premium (such as missile guidance and telemetry systems) and in high-speed computers, where short traces were important. In cordwood construction, axial-leaded components were mounted between two parallel planes. The components were either soldered together with jumper wire, or they were connected to other components by thin nickel ribbon welded at right angles onto the component leads. To avoid shorting together different interconnection layers, thin insulating cards were placed between them. Perforations or holes in the cards allowed component leads to project through to the next interconnection layer. One disadvantage of this system was that special nickel-leaded components had to be used to allow the interconnecting welds to be made. Differential thermal expansion of the component could put pressure on the leads of the components and the PCB traces and cause physical damage (as was seen in several modules on the Apollo program). Additionally, components located in the interior are difficult to replace. Some versions of cordwood construction used soldered single-sided PCBs as the interconnection method (as pictured), allowing the use of normal-leaded components.\n\nQ: What gets mounted in the middle of two parallel planes in a cordwood construction?\n\nA: axial-leaded components\n\nTitle: Roman_Republic\n\nBackground: Roman religious beliefs date back to the founding of Rome, around 800 BC. However, the Roman religion commonly associated with the republic and early empire did not begin until around 500 BC, when Romans came in contact with Greek culture, and adopted many of the Greek religious beliefs. Private and personal worship was an important aspect of religious practices. In a sense, each household was a temple to the gods. Each household had an altar (lararium), at which the family members would offer prayers, perform rites, and interact with the household gods. Many of the gods that Romans worshiped came from the Proto-Indo-European pantheon, others were based on Greek gods. The two most famous deities were Jupiter (the king God) and Mars (the god of war). With its cultural influence spreading over most of the Mediterranean, Romans began accepting foreign gods into their own culture, as well as other philosophical traditions such as Cynicism and Stoicism.\n\nQ: What in Roman society was considered to be a temple to the gods?\n\nA: each household\n\nTitle: Australian dollar\n\nBackground: against counterfeiting. The polymer notes are cleaner than paper notes, are more durable and easily recyclable. Australia's currency comprises coins of 5, 10, 20 and 50 cent and one and two dollar denominations; and notes of 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 dollar denominations. Many forms of currency were used in the Australian colonies after the arrival of the first European settlers in 1788. In the rough early conditions barter was necessary, and payment in commodities like rum sometimes replaced money in transactions. Some of the first official notes used in Australia were Police Fund Notes, issued by the Bank\n\nQ: ['what type of currency is used in australia?']\n\nA:",

The Yangtze River flows past the west side and then north side of Nanjing City, while the Ningzheng Ridge surrounds the north, east and south side of the city. The city is 300 kilometres (190 mi) west-northwest of Shanghai, 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) south-southeast of Beijing, and 1,400 kilometres (870 mi) east-northeast of Chongqing. The downstream Yangtze River flows from Jiujiang, Jiangxi, through Anhui and Jiangsu to East Sea, north to drainage basin of downstream Yangtze is Huai River basin and south to it is Zhe River basin, and they are connected by the Grand Canal east to Nanjing. The area around Nanjing is called Hsiajiang (\u4e0b\u6c5f, Downstream River) region, with Jianghuai (\u6c5f\u6dee) stressing northern part and Jiangzhe (\u6c5f\u6d59) stressing southern part.

Feynman's account reveals a disconnect between NASA's engineers and executives that was far more striking than he expected. His interviews of NASA's high-ranking managers revealed startling misunderstandings of elementary concepts. For instance, NASA managers claimed that there was a 1 in 100,000 chance of a catastrophic failure aboard the shuttle, but Feynman discovered that NASA's own engineers estimated the chance of a catastrophe at closer to 1 in 200. He concluded that the space shuttle reliability estimate by NASA management was fantastically unrealistic, and he was particularly angered that NASA used these figures to recruit Christa McAuliffe into the Teacher-in-Space program. He warned in his appendix to the commission's report (which was included only after he threatened not to sign the report), \"For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.\"\n\nQ: Feyman's experience on the Rogers Commission was talked about is which of his books?\n\nA: What Do You Care What Other People Think?\n\nTitle: Linen\n\nBackground: due to its absorption of sweat from hands. Paper made of linen can be very strong and crisp, which is why the United States and many other countries print their currency on paper made from 25% linen and 75% cotton. Linen Linen is a textile made from the fibers of the flax plant. Linen is laborious to manufacture, but the fiber is very strong, absorbent and dries faster than cotton. Garments made of linen are valued for their exceptional coolness and freshness in hot and humid weather.

        "prompt": "Title: Melbourne\n\nBackground: Melbourne is an international cultural centre, with cultural endeavours spanning major events and festivals, drama, musicals, comedy, music, art, architecture, literature, film and television. The climate, waterfront location and nightlife make it one of the most vibrant destinations in Australia. For five years in a row (as of 2015) it has held the top position in a survey by The Economist Intelligence Unit of the world's most liveable cities on the basis of a number of attributes which include its broad cultural offerings. The city celebrates a wide variety of annual cultural events and festivals of all types, including Australia's largest free community festival\u2014Moomba, the Melbourne International Arts Festival, Melbourne International Film Festival, Melbourne International Comedy Festival and the Melbourne Fringe Festival. The culture of the city is an important drawcard for tourists, of which just under two million international overnight visitors and 57.7 million domestic overnight visited during the year ending March 2014.\n\nQ: For how many years in a row has Melbourne held the top position in a survey of the world's most liveable cities?\n\nA: five\n\nTitle: Norfolk_Island\n\nBackground: Residents of Norfolk Island do not pay Australian federal taxes, creating a tax haven for locals and visitors alike. Because there is no income tax, the island's legislative assembly raises money through an import duty, fuel levy, medicare levy, GST of 12% and local/international phone calls. In a move that apparently surprised many islanders the Chief Minister of Norfolk Island, David Buffett, announced on 6 November 2010 that the island would voluntarily surrender its tax free status in return for a financial bailout from the federal government to cover significant debts. The introduction of income taxation will now come into effect on July 1, 2016, with a variation of opinion on the island about these changes but with many understanding that for the island's governance to continue there is a need to pay into the commonwealth revenue pool so that the island can have assistance in supporting its delivery of State government responsibilities such as health, education, medicare, and infrastructure. Prior to these reforms residents of Norfolk Island were not entitled to social services. It appears that the reforms do extend to companies and trustees and not only individuals.\n\nQ: Norfolk Island inhabitants and visitors don't pay what?\n\nA: Australian federal taxes\n\nTitle: Bat as food\n\nBackground: flavor of fruit bats is similar to that of chicken, and that they are \"clean animals living exclusively on fruit\". Bats are prepared in several manners, such as grilled, barbecued, deep fried, cooked in stews and in stir frys. When deep fried, the entire bat may be cooked and consumed. Bats have a low fat content and are high in protein. During cooking, bats may emit strong odors reminiscent of urine. This may be reduced by adding garlic, onion, chili pepper or beer during cooking. Eating fruit bats is linked to a neurological disease called lytico-bodig disease. Paul Alan Cox\n\nQ: ['what do bats eat?']\n\nA:",

In 1889, during a stay in Biarritz, she became the first reigning monarch from Britain to set foot in Spain when she crossed the border for a brief visit. By April 1900, the Boer War was so unpopular in mainland Europe that her annual trip to France seemed inadvisable. Instead, the Queen went to Ireland for the first time since 1861, in part to acknowledge the contribution of Irish regiments to the South African war. In July, her second son Alfred (\"Affie\") died; \"Oh, God! My poor darling Affie gone too\", she wrote in her journal. \"It is a horrible year, nothing but sadness & horrors of one kind & another.\"\n\nQ: Why did Victoria visit Ireland in 1861?\n\nA: acknowledge the contribution of Irish regiments to the South African war\n\nTitle: I Don't Care Anymore (George Harrison song)\n\nBackground: his North American tour with Ravi Shankar, Harrison recorded an interview with BBC Radio 1 DJ Alan Freeman in which he performed three new songs, along with a snippet of his \"All Things Must Pass\" track \"Awaiting on You All\". The final song Harrison played was \"I Don't Care Anymore\", sung in a cleaner-sounding voice than the officially released version, and with lyrics amended to thank Freeman for his support over the years. This interview was broadcast on 6 December 1974 in Britain but delayed until September 1975 in America, where it was used to promote Harrison's 1975 album, \"Extra\n\nQ: [\"who sings the song i don't care anymore?\"]\n\nA:",

The metropolitan area is home to an estimated 1.1 million (21.4 percent) residents who were born outside the United States, with nearly two-thirds of the area's foreign-born population from south of the United States\u2013Mexico border.

The Umayyad Caliphate was the second Islamic caliphate established after the death of Muhammad. It was ruled by the Umayyad dynasty, whose name derives from Umayya ibn Abd Shams, the great-grandfather of the first Umayyad caliph. Although the Umayyad family originally came from the city of Mecca, their capital was Damascus. Muhammad bin Qasim was the first to bring message of Islam to the population of Punjab.[citation needed] Punjab was part of different Muslim Empires consisting of Afghans and Turkic peoples in co-operation with local Punjabi tribes and others.[citation needed] In the 11th century, during the reign of Mahmud of Ghazni, the province became an important centre with Lahore as its second capital[citation needed] of the Ghaznavid Empire based out of Afghanistan.

The Russian fleet during this time declined to engage the allies, preferring to maintain a \"fleet in being\"; this strategy failed when Sevastopol, the main port and where most of the Black Sea fleet was based, came under siege. The Russians were reduced to scuttling their warships as blockships, after stripping them of their guns and men to reinforce batteries on shore. During the siege, the Russians lost four 110- or 120-gun, three-decker ships of the line, twelve 84-gun two-deckers and four 60-gun frigates in the Black Sea, plus a large number of smaller vessels.

According to them, many of her songs have the imagery of the music video in strong context, while referring to the music. Cultural critic Mark C. Taylor in his book Nots (1993) felt that the postmodern art form par excellence is video and the reigning \"queen of video\" is Madonna. He further asserted that \"the most remarkable creation of MTV is Madonna. The responses to Madonna's excessively provocative videos have been predictably contradictory.\" The media and public reaction towards her most-discussed songs such as \"Papa Don't Preach\", \"Like a Prayer\", or \"Justify My Love\" had to do with the music videos created to promote the songs and their impact, rather than the songs themselves. Morton felt that \"artistically, Madonna's songwriting is often overshadowed by her striking pop videos.\"\n\nQ: The most remarkable creation in MTV is whom?\n\nA: Madonna\n\nTitle: Shelikof Strait\n\nBackground: Shelikof Strait Shelikof Strait is a strait on the southwestern coast of the U.S. state of Alaska between the Alaska mainland to the west and Kodiak and Afognak islands to the east.

Increasingly the Byzantine Church differed in language, practices, and liturgy from the western Church. The eastern church used Greek instead of the western Latin. Theological and political differences emerged, and by the early and middle 8th century issues such as iconoclasm, clerical marriage, and state control of the church had widened to the extent that the cultural and religious differences were greater than the similarities. The formal break came in 1054, when the papacy and the patriarchy of Constantinople clashed over papal supremacy and excommunicated each other, which led to the division of Christianity into two churches\u2014the western branch became the Roman Catholic Church and the eastern branch the Orthodox Church.\n\nQ: What was the eastern church subsequently known as?\n\nA: the Orthodox Church\n\nTitle: Xbox_360\n\nBackground: Xbox Live Arcade is an online service operated by Microsoft that is used to distribute downloadable video games to Xbox and Xbox 360 owners.

The Xbox Live Arcade also features games from other consoles, such as the PlayStation game Castlevania: Symphony of the Night and PC games such as Zuma. The service was first launched on November 3, 2004, using a DVD to load, and offered games for about US$5 to $15. Items are purchased using Microsoft Points, a proprietary currency used to reduce credit card transaction charges. On November 22, 2005, Xbox Live Arcade was re-launched with the release of the Xbox 360, in which it was now integrated with the Xbox 360's dashboard. The games are generally aimed toward more casual gamers; examples of the more popular titles are Geometry Wars, Street Fighter II' Hyper Fighting, and Uno. On March 24, 2010, Microsoft introduced the Game Room to Xbox Live.

A coin toss is held to determine which team will take possession first; the first team scrimmages the ball at the opponent's 35-yard line and advances through a series of downs until it scores or loses possession. If the team scores a touchdown, starting with the 2010 season, it is required to attempt a 2-point conversion. The other team then scrimmages the ball at the same 35-yard line and has the same opportunity to score. After the teams have completed their possessions, if one team is ahead, then it is declared the winner; otherwise, the two teams each get another chance to score, scrimmaging from the other 35-yard line. After this second round, if there is still no winner, during the regular season the game ends as a tie.

        "prompt": "Title: Plymouth\n\nBackground: The 1971 Local Government White Paper proposed abolishing county boroughs, which would have left Plymouth, a town of 250,000 people, being administered from a council based at the smaller Exeter, on the other side of the county. This led to Plymouth lobbying for the creation of a Tamarside county, to include Plymouth, Torpoint, Saltash, and the rural hinterland. The campaign was not successful, and Plymouth ceased to be a county borough on 1 April 1974 with responsibility for education, social services, highways and libraries transferred to Devon County Council. All powers returned when the city become a unitary authority on 1 April 1998 under recommendations of the Banham Commission.\n\nQ: On what date did Plymouth's county status end?\n\nA: 1 April 1974\n\nTitle: Energy\n\nBackground: There are strict limits to how efficiently heat can be converted into work in a cyclic process, e.g. in a heat engine, as described by Carnot's theorem and the second law of thermodynamics. However, some energy transformations can be quite efficient. The direction of transformations in energy (what kind of energy is transformed to what other kind) is often determined by entropy (equal energy spread among all available degrees of freedom) considerations. In practice all energy transformations are permitted on a small scale, but certain larger transformations are not permitted because it is statistically unlikely that energy or matter will randomly move into more concentrated forms or smaller spaces.\n\nQ: What is often determined by entropy considerations?\n\nA: direction of transformations in energy\n\nTitle: Bettina Walker\n\nBackground: Bettina Walker Bettina or Bessie Walker (1837 \u2013 4 February 1893) was an Irish pianist and composer. Walker was born in Dublin, the daughter of physician William Augustus Walker, who died in 1838. Walker studied in the 1870s, first with William Sterndale Bennett in London and Carl Tausig in Berlin and Giovanni Sgambati in Rome. In 1883 she came to Weimar and continued her studies with Franz Liszt. She also studied under Ludwig Deppe, Xaver Scharwenka and Adolf Henselt. After Henselt's death in 1889 she settled in Fulham, London, where she taught her piano methodology, but died four years later.\n\nQ: ['where was alice walker born?']\n\nA:",

When his back was to the wall in 1814 he tried to reopen peace negotiations on the basis of accepting the Frankfurt proposals. The Allies now had new, harsher terms that included the retreat of France to its 1791 boundaries, which meant the loss of Belgium. Napoleon would remain Emperor, however he rejected the term.

Accordingly, Masons swear at each degree to keep the contents of that degree secret, and to support and protect their brethren unless they have broken the law. In most Lodges the oath or obligation is taken on a Volume of Sacred Law, whichever book of divine revelation is appropriate to the religious beliefs of the individual brother (usually the Bible in the Anglo-American tradition).

        "prompt": "Title: Sumer\n\nBackground: They invented and developed arithmetic by using several different number systems including a mixed radix system with an alternating base 10 and base 6. This sexagesimal system became the standard number system in Sumer and Babylonia. They may have invented military formations and introduced the basic divisions between infantry, cavalry, and archers. They developed the first known codified legal and administrative systems, complete with courts, jails, and government records. The first true city-states arose in Sumer, roughly contemporaneously with similar entities in what are now Syria and Lebanon. Several centuries after the invention of cuneiform, the use of writing expanded beyond debt/payment certificates and inventory lists to be applied for the first time, about 2600 BC, to messages and mail delivery, history, legend, mathematics, astronomical records, and other pursuits. Conjointly with the spread of writing, the first formal schools were established, usually under the auspices of a city-state's primary temple.\n\nQ: What type of formations is it possible Sumerians invented?\n\nA: military\n\nTitle: American_Idol\n\nBackground: As one of the most successful shows on U.S. television history, American Idol has a strong impact not just on television, but also in the wider world of entertainment.

In 1957, the Saar Protectorate rejoined the Federal Republic as the Saarland. German reunification in 1990, in which the German Democratic Republic (East Germany) ascended into the Federal Republic, resulted in the addition of the re-established eastern states of Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-West Pomerania (in German Mecklenburg-Vorpommern), Saxony (Sachsen), Saxony-Anhalt (Sachsen-Anhalt), and Thuringia (Th\u00fcringen), as well as the reunification of West and East Berlin into Berlin and its establishment as a full and equal state.

        "prompt": "Title: Gene\n\nBackground: Advances in understanding genes and inheritance continued throughout the 20th century. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was shown to be the molecular repository of genetic information by experiments in the 1940s to 1950s. The structure of DNA was studied by Rosalind Franklin using X-ray crystallography, which led James D. Watson and Francis Crick to publish a model of the double-stranded DNA molecule whose paired nucleotide bases indicated a compelling hypothesis for the mechanism of genetic replication. Collectively, this body of research established the central dogma of molecular biology, which states that proteins are translated from RNA, which is transcribed from DNA. This dogma has since been shown to have exceptions, such as reverse transcription in retroviruses. The modern study of genetics at the level of DNA is known as molecular genetics.\n\nQ: What was shown to be the molecular repository of genetic information by experiments in the 1940s to 1950s?\n\nA: Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)\n\nTitle: Daylight_saving_time\n\nBackground: The manipulation of time at higher latitudes (for example Iceland, Nunavut or Alaska) has little impact on daily life, because the length of day and night changes more extremely throughout the seasons (in comparison to other latitudes), and thus sunrise and sunset times are significantly out of sync with standard working hours regardless of manipulations of the clock. DST is also of little use for locations near the equator, because these regions see only a small variation in daylight in the course of the year.\n\nQ: As compared to areas with lower latitudes, what kind of change do areas with high latitudes see in the length of day through the seasons?\n\nA: extreme\n\nTitle: Ronald Reagan 1980 presidential campaign\n\nBackground: Ronald Reagan 1980 presidential campaign Ronald Reagan, the 33rd Governor of California (served 1967\u20131975), announced his candidacy for President of the United States in New York City on November 13, 1979. On July 17, 1980, he became the nominee of the Republican Party for the 1980 presidential election.

The Manchus are sometimes mistaken for a nomadic people, which they were not. What was to become the Manchu state was founded by Nurhaci, the chieftain of a minor Jurchen tribe \u2013 the Aisin Gioro \u2013 in Jianzhou in the early 17th century. Originally a vassal of the Ming emperors, Nurhachi embarked on an intertribal feud in 1582 that escalated into a campaign to unify the nearby tribes.

The meeting condemned plans by the European \"foreign power elite\" to destabilize the country. The forum also expressed solidarity with the Morales and his economic and social changes in the interest of historically marginalized majorities.

As a group of Reform Rabbis convened in Braunschweig, Rabbi Jacob Ettlinger of Altona published a manifesto entitled \"Shlomei Emunei Yisrael\" in German and Hebrew, having 177 Rabbis sign on. At this time the first Orthodox Jewish periodical, \"Der Treue Zions Waechter\", was launched with the Hebrew supplement \"Shomer Zion HaNe'eman\" [1845 - 1855].

        "prompt": "Title: IBM\n\nBackground: IBM was among the first corporations to provide group life insurance (1934), survivor benefits (1935) and paid vacations (1937). In 1932 IBM created an Education Department to oversee training for employees, which oversaw the completion of the IBM Schoolhouse at Endicott in 1933. In 1935, the employee magazine Think was created. Also that year, IBM held its first training class for female systems service professionals. In 1942, IBM launched a program to train and employ disabled people in Topeka, Kansas. The next year classes began in New York City, and soon the company was asked to join the President's Committee for Employment of the Handicapped. In 1946, the company hired its first black salesman, 18 years before the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 1947, IBM announced a Total and Permanent Disability Income Plan for employees. A vested rights pension was added to the IBM retirement plan. During IBM's management transformation in the 1990s revisions were made to these pension plans to reduce IBM's pension liabilities.\n\nQ: IBM employees created a magazine in 1935, what was its name?\n\nA: Think\n\nTitle: Software_testing\n\nBackground: Development Testing is a software development process that involves synchronized application of a broad spectrum of defect prevention and detection strategies in order to reduce software development risks, time, and costs. It is performed by the software developer or engineer during the construction phase of the software development lifecycle. Rather than replace traditional QA focuses, it augments it. Development Testing aims to eliminate construction errors before code is promoted to QA; this strategy is intended to increase the quality of the resulting software as well as the efficiency of the overall development and QA process.\n\nQ: What does Development testing look to eliminate?\n\nA: construction errors\n\nTitle: Jenny (Doctor Who)\n\nBackground: conclusion. Before being cast as Jenny, Georgia Moffett had previously auditioned for a smaller role in \"Doctor Who\" episode \"The Unicorn and the Wasp\". Phil Collinson revealed that: \"As soon as we saw her, we realised there was a much bigger and better part later on in the series... so Georgia kindly waited until the time was right.\" Coverage of her casting focused on the fact that Moffett is the daughter of Peter Davison, who played the Doctor's fifth incarnation\u2014as the \"Radio Times\" stated: \"a Doctor's daughter is playing the Doctor's Daughter\".

One commentator observed that Imperial's scheme reflected \"the state of democracy in Kent, the transformation of a renowned scientific college into a grasping, highly aggressive, neo-corporate institution, and the defence of the status of an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty \u2013 throughout England, not just Wye \u2013 against rampant greed backed by the connivance of two important local authorities.

        "prompt": "Title: Police\n\nBackground: Michel Foucault claims that the contemporary concept of police as a paid and funded functionary of the state was developed by German and French legal scholars and practitioners in Public administration and Statistics in the 17th and early 18th centuries, most notably with Nicolas Delamare's Trait\u00e9 de la Police (\"Treatise on the Police\"), first published in 1705. The German Polizeiwissenschaft (Science of Police) first theorized by Philipp von H\u00f6rnigk a 17th-century Austrian Political economist and civil servant and much more famously by Johann Heinrich Gottlob Justi who produced an important theoretical work known as Cameral science on the formulation of police. Foucault cites Magdalene Humpert author of Bibliographie der Kameralwissenschaften (1937) in which the author makes note of a substantial bibliography was produced of over 4000 pieces of the practice of Polizeiwissenschaft however, this maybe a mistranslation of Foucault's own work the actual source of Magdalene Humpert states over 14,000 items were produced from the 16th century dates ranging from 1520-1850.\n\nQ: What was the 'Treatise on the Police' called in French?\n\nA: Trait\u00e9 de la Police\n\nTitle: Ottoman_Empire\n\nBackground: Until the 19th century, Ottoman prose did not develop to the extent that contemporary Divan poetry did. A large part of the reason for this was that much prose was expected to adhere to the rules of sec (\u0633\u062c\u0639, also transliterated as seci), or rhymed prose, a type of writing descended from the Arabic saj' and which prescribed that between each adjective and noun in a string of words, such as a sentence, there must be a rhyme. Nevertheless, there was a tradition of prose in the literature of the time, though exclusively non-fictional in nature. One apparent exception was Muhayyel\u00e2t (\"Fancies\") by Giritli Ali Aziz Efendi, a collection of stories of the fantastic written in 1796, though not published until 1867. The first novel published in the Ottoman Empire was by an Armenian named Vartan Pasha. Published in 1851, the novel was entitled The Story of Akabi (Turkish: Akabi Hikyayesi) and was written in Turkish but with Armenian script.\n\nQ: Who wrote Muhayyel\u00e2t?\n\nA: Giritli Ali Aziz Efendi\n\nTitle: Variety store\n\nBackground: impulse purchases. Among today's dollar stores are: Stores: In Argentina, variety stores are called todo por dos pesos (2 pesos). In Brazil, these stores are called um e noventa e nove (one and ninety-nine, meaning BRL1.99, about US$1.20) usually written as 1,99. They began to appear in the 1990s possibly as a consequence of both the increase in the purchasing power of the low income classes after the curbing of hyperinflation and the decrease in middle-class net income due to a gradual increase in the national average tax load. Brazilians sometimes use the expression \"um e noventa e nove\" to\n\nQ: ['what is the dollar called in brazil?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Franco-Prussian_War\n\nBackground: At the outset of the Franco-Prussian War, 462,000 German soldiers concentrated on the French frontier while only 270,000 French soldiers could be moved to face them, the French army having lost 100,000 stragglers before a shot was fired through poor planning and administration. This was partly due to the peacetime organisations of the armies. Each Prussian Corps was based within a Kreis (literally \"circle\") around the chief city in an area. Reservists rarely lived more than a day's travel from their regiment's depot. By contrast, French regiments generally served far from their depots, which in turn were not in the areas of France from which their soldiers were drawn. Reservists often faced several days' journey to report to their depots, and then another long journey to join their regiments. Large numbers of reservists choked railway stations, vainly seeking rations and orders.\n\nQ: How many French troops were available to stand again the Germans?\n\nA: 270,000\n\nTitle: Beyonc\u00e9\n\nBackground: At the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards, Beyonc\u00e9 received ten nominations, including Album of the Year for I Am... Sasha Fierce, Record of the Year for \"Halo\", and Song of the Year for \"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\", among others. She tied with Lauryn Hill for most Grammy nominations in a single year by a female artist. In 2010, Beyonc\u00e9 was featured on Lady Gaga's single \"Telephone\" and its music video. The song topped the US Pop Songs chart, becoming the sixth number-one for both Beyonc\u00e9 and Gaga, tying them with Mariah Carey for most number-ones since the Nielsen Top 40 airplay chart launched in 1992. \"Telephone\" received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.\n\nQ: In 2010, Beyonce worked with which other famous singer?\n\nA: Lady Gaga\n\nTitle: Plains of Abraham\n\nBackground: the National Battlefields Commission placed a column identical to one that had been built on the site in 1849, and a replica Cross of Sacrifice was constructed on the plains to commemorate soldiers who were lost in World War I; it continues to be the location of Remembrance Day ceremonies every year. On September 13, 1759, the area was the scene of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham, part of the French and Indian War, which was itself part of the Seven Years' War. On that date, British soldiers under the command of General Wolfe, climbed the steep cliff\n\nQ: ['where did the plains of abraham take place?']\n\nA:",

These are the Book on Numbers and Computation, the Arithmetical Classic of the Gnomon and the Circular Paths of Heaven and the Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art. Han-era mathematical achievements include solving problems with right-angle triangles, square roots, cube roots, and matrix methods, finding more accurate approximations for pi, providing mathematical proof of the Pythagorean theorem, use of the decimal fraction, Gaussian elimination to solve linear equations, and continued fractions to find the roots of equations.\n\nQ: How many mathematical treatises have still managed to survive to this day?\n\nA: Three\n\nTitle: Gothic_architecture\n\nBackground: The distinctive characteristic of Italian Gothic is the use of polychrome decoration, both externally as marble veneer on the brick fa\u00e7ade and also internally where the arches are often made of alternating black and white segments, and where the columns may be painted red, the walls decorated with frescoes and the apse with mosaic. The plan is usually regular and symmetrical, Italian cathedrals have few and widely spaced columns. The proportions are generally mathematically equilibrated, based on the square and the concept of \"armon\u00eca\", and except in Venice where they loved flamboyant arches, the arches are almost always equilateral. Colours and moldings define the architectural units rather than blending them. Italian cathedral fa\u00e7ades are often polychrome and may include mosaics in the lunettes over the doors. The fa\u00e7ades have projecting open porches and occular or wheel windows rather than roses, and do not usually have a tower. The crossing is usually surmounted by a dome. There is often a free-standing tower and baptistry. The eastern end usually has an apse of comparatively low projection. The windows are not as large as in northern Europe and, although stained glass windows are often found, the favourite narrative medium for the interior is the fresco.\n\nQ: What is the unique characteristic of Italian Gothic design?\n\nA: the use of polychrome decoration\n\nTitle: Fascism\n\nBackground: made plans to take Rome. On 24 October 1922, the Fascist party held its annual congress in Naples, where Mussolini ordered Blackshirts to take control of public buildings and trains and to converge on three points around Rome. The Fascists managed to seize control of several post offices and trains in northern Italy while the Italian government, led by a left-wing coalition, was internally divided and unable to respond to the Fascist advances. King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy perceived the risk of bloodshed in Rome in response to attempting to disperse the Fascists to be too high.

        "prompt": "Title: Infection\n\nBackground: Technologies based upon the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method will become nearly ubiquitous gold standards of diagnostics of the near future, for several reasons. First, the catalog of infectious agents has grown to the point that virtually all of the significant infectious agents of the human population have been identified. Second, an infectious agent must grow within the human body to cause disease; essentially it must amplify its own nucleic acids in order to cause a disease. This amplification of nucleic acid in infected tissue offers an opportunity to detect the infectious agent by using PCR. Third, the essential tools for directing PCR, primers, are derived from the genomes of infectious agents, and with time those genomes will be known, if they are not already.\n\nQ: What must an infectious agent do to cause disease?\n\nA: grow within the human body\n\nTitle: Annelid\n\nBackground: However, leeches and their closest relatives have a body structure that is very uniform within the group but significantly different from that of other annelids, including other members of the Clitellata. In leeches there are no septa, the connective tissue layer of the body wall is so thick that it occupies much of the body, and the two coelomata are widely separated and run the length of the body. They function as the main blood vessels, although they are side-by-side rather than upper and lower. However, they are lined with mesothelium, like the coelomata and unlike the blood vessels of other annelids. Leeches generally use suckers at their front and rear ends to move like inchworms. The anus is on the upper surface of the pygidium.\n\nQ: What type of annelids are very different from others?\n\nA: leeches and their closest relatives\n\nTitle: Poliomyelitis\n\nBackground: is a Western plot to sterilise local children. 66 vaccinators were killed in 2013 and 2014. Cases have dropped by 70 percent in 2015; reasons include Dh440 million support from the United Arab Emirates to vaccinate more than ten million children, changes in the military situation, and arrests of some of those who attacked polio workers. The effects of polio have been known since prehistory; Egyptian paintings and carvings depict otherwise healthy people with withered limbs, and children walking with canes at a young age.

        "prompt": "Title: Steven_Spielberg\n\nBackground: Based on the strength of his work, Universal signed Spielberg to do four TV films. The first was a Richard Matheson adaptation called Duel. The film is about a psychotic Peterbilt 281 tanker truck driver who chases the terrified driver (Dennis Weaver) of a small Plymouth Valiant and tries to run him off the road. Special praise of this film by the influential British critic Dilys Powell was highly significant to Spielberg's career. Another TV film (Something Evil) was made and released to capitalize on the popularity of The Exorcist, then a major best-selling book which had not yet been released as a film. He fulfilled his contract by directing the TV film-length pilot of a show called Savage, starring Martin Landau. Spielberg's debut full-length feature film was The Sugarland Express, about a married couple who are chased by police as the couple tries to regain custody of their baby. Spielberg's cinematography for the police chase was praised by reviewers, and The Hollywood Reporter stated that \"a major new director is on the horizon.\":223 However, the film fared poorly at the box office and received a limited release.\n\nQ: What kind of truck was 'Duel' about?\n\nA: Peterbilt 281 tanker\n\nTitle: Translation\n\nBackground: In general, translators have sought to preserve the context itself by reproducing the original order of sememes, and hence word order \u2014 when necessary, reinterpreting the actual grammatical structure, for example, by shifting from active to passive voice, or vice versa. The grammatical differences between \"fixed-word-order\" languages (e.g. English, French, German) and \"free-word-order\" languages (e.g., Greek, Latin, Polish, Russian) have been no impediment in this regard. The particular syntax (sentence-structure) characteristics of a text's source language are adjusted to the syntactic requirements of the target language.\n\nQ: What is it sometimes necessary to reinterpret when translating?\n\nA: grammatical structure\n\nTitle: Ethan Hawke\n\nBackground: adding \"I would never recommend that a kid act.\" In 1989, Hawke made his breakthrough appearance in Peter Weir's \"Dead Poets Society\", playing one of the students taught by Robin Williams's inspirational English teacher. The \"Variety\" reviewer noted \"Hawke, as the painfully shy Todd, gives a haunting performance.\" The film received considerable acclaim, winning the BAFTA Award for Best Film and an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. With revenue of $235 million worldwide, it remains Hawke's most commercially successful picture to date. Hawke later described the opportunities he was offered as a result of the film's success as critical\n\nQ: [\"who played the teacher in dead poet's society?\"]\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: ASCII\n\nBackground: From early in its development, ASCII was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard, ultimately published as ISO/IEC 646 (1972), which would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several code points reserved for \"national use.\" However, the four years that elapsed between the publication of ASCII-1963 and ISO's first acceptance of an international recommendation during 1967 caused ASCII's choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world, causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points.\n\nQ: What was causing the confusion and incompatibility of the code points?\n\nA: ASCII's choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world\n\nTitle: Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States\n\nBackground: Traditionally, Section 1983 was of limited use for a state prisoner under sentence of death because the Supreme Court has held that habeas corpus, not Section 1983, is the only vehicle by which a state prisoner can challenge his judgment of death. In the 2006 Hill v. McDonough case, however, the United States Supreme Court approved the use of Section 1983 as a vehicle for challenging a state's method of execution as cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment. The theory is that a prisoner bringing such a challenge is not attacking directly his judgment of death, but rather the means by which that the judgment will be carried out. Therefore, the Supreme Court held in the Hill case that a prisoner can use Section 1983 rather than habeas corpus to bring the lawsuit. Yet, as Clarence Hill's own case shows, lower federal courts have often refused to hear suits challenging methods of execution on the ground that the prisoner brought the claim too late and only for the purposes of delay. Further, the Court's decision in Baze v. Rees, upholding a lethal injection method used by many states, has drastically narrowed the opportunity for relief through Section 1983.\n\nQ: In what year was Hill v. McDonough decided?\n\nA: 2006\n\nTitle: Conclusion of the American Civil War\n\nBackground: surrendered at Liverpool, England. President Johnson formally declared the end of the war on August 20, 1866. General Robert E. Lee commanded the Army of Northern Virginia, while Major General John Brown Gordon commanded its Second Corps. Early in the morning of April 9, Gordon attacked, aiming to break through Federal lines at the Battle of Appomattox Court House, but failed, and the Confederate Army was then surrounded. At 8:30 A.M. that morning, Lee requested a meeting with Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant to discuss surrendering the Army of Northern Virginia. Shortly after twelve o'clock, Grant's reply reached Lee, and\n\nQ: ['where did lee surrender to grant to end the civil war?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Solar_energy\n\nBackground: Solar concentrating technologies such as parabolic dish, trough and Scheffler reflectors can provide process heat for commercial and industrial applications. The first commercial system was the Solar Total Energy Project (STEP) in Shenandoah, Georgia, USA where a field of 114 parabolic dishes provided 50% of the process heating, air conditioning and electrical requirements for a clothing factory. This grid-connected cogeneration system provided 400 kW of electricity plus thermal energy in the form of 401 kW steam and 468 kW chilled water, and had a one-hour peak load thermal storage. Evaporation ponds are shallow pools that concentrate dissolved solids through evaporation. The use of evaporation ponds to obtain salt from sea water is one of the oldest applications of solar energy. Modern uses include concentrating brine solutions used in leach mining and removing dissolved solids from waste streams. Clothes lines, clotheshorses, and clothes racks dry clothes through evaporation by wind and sunlight without consuming electricity or gas. In some states of the United States legislation protects the \"right to dry\" clothes. Unglazed transpired collectors (UTC) are perforated sun-facing walls used for preheating ventilation air. UTCs can raise the incoming air temperature up to 22 \u00b0C (40 \u00b0F) and deliver outlet temperatures of 45\u201360 \u00b0C (113\u2013140 \u00b0F). The short payback period of transpired collectors (3 to 12 years) makes them a more cost-effective alternative than glazed collection systems. As of 2003, over 80 systems with a combined collector area of 35,000 square metres (380,000 sq ft) had been installed worldwide, including an 860 m2 (9,300 sq ft) collector in Costa Rica used for drying coffee beans and a 1,300 m2 (14,000 sq ft) collector in Coimbatore, India, used for drying marigolds.\n\nQ: The Solar Total Energy Project had a field of how many parabolic dishes?\n\nA: 114\n\nTitle: University\n\nBackground: In Canada, \"college\" generally refers to a two-year, non-degree-granting institution, while \"university\" connotes a four-year, degree-granting institution.

        "prompt": "Title: United_States_presidential_election,_2004\n\nBackground: In sheer numbers, Kerry had fewer endorsements than Howard Dean, who was far ahead in the superdelegate race going into the Iowa caucuses in January 2004, although Kerry led the endorsement race in Iowa, New Hampshire, Arizona, South Carolina, New Mexico and Nevada. Kerry's main perceived weakness was in his neighboring state of New Hampshire and nearly all national polls. Most other states did not have updated polling numbers to give an accurate placing for the Kerry campaign before Iowa. Heading into the primaries, Kerry's campaign was largely seen as in trouble, particularly after he fired campaign manager Jim Jordan. The key factors enabling it to survive were when fellow Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy assigned Mary Beth Cahill to be the campaign manager, as well as Kerry's mortgaging his own home to lend the money to his campaign (while his wife was a billionaire, campaign finance rules prohibited using one's personal fortune). He also brought on the \"magical\" Michael Whouley who would be credited with helping bring home the Iowa victory the same as he did in New Hampshire for Al Gore in 2000 against Bill Bradley.\n\nQ: What regulation did Kerry not follow to try to save his campaign?\n\nA: mortgaging his own home to lend the money to his campaign\n\nTitle: Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation\n\nBackground: The National Incident Based Reporting System (NIBRS) crime statistics system aims to address limitations inherent in UCR data. The system is used by law enforcement agencies in the United States for collecting and reporting data on crimes. Local, state, and federal agencies generate NIBRS data from their records management systems. Data is collected on every incident and arrest in the Group A offense category. The Group A offenses are 46 specific crimes grouped in 22 offense categories. Specific facts about these offenses are gathered and reported in the NIBRS system. In addition to the Group A offenses, eleven Group B offenses are reported with only the arrest information. The NIBRS system is in greater detail than the summary-based UCR system. As of 2004, 5,271 law enforcement agencies submitted NIBRS data. That amount represents 20% of the United States population and 16% of the crime statistics data collected by the FBI.\n\nQ: Who uses the NIBRS?\n\nA: the United States\n\nTitle: Severance package\n\nBackground: year of employment. An employee with more than five years but less than fifteen years of employment must receive a severance payment equal to three months of salary, plus an additional two weeks of salary for each year of employment. An employee with more than fifteen years of service must receive a severance payment equal to six months of salary, plus an additional three weeks of salary for each year of employment. In the United Kingdom Labour Law provides for \"Redundancy Pay\". The maximum amount of statutory redundancy pay is \u00a315,240.

        "prompt": "Title: Capacitor\n\nBackground: Capacitors may catastrophically fail when subjected to voltages or currents beyond their rating, or as they reach their normal end of life. Dielectric or metal interconnection failures may create arcing that vaporizes the dielectric fluid, resulting in case bulging, rupture, or even an explosion. Capacitors used in RF or sustained high-current applications can overheat, especially in the center of the capacitor rolls. Capacitors used within high-energy capacitor banks can violently explode when a short in one capacitor causes sudden dumping of energy stored in the rest of the bank into the failing unit. High voltage vacuum capacitors can generate soft X-rays even during normal operation. Proper containment, fusing, and preventive maintenance can help to minimize these hazards.\n\nQ: What is one way to help minimize capacitor dangers?\n\nA: preventive maintenance\n\nTitle: Seattle\n\nBackground: Seattle in this period attracted widespread attention as home to these many companies, but also by hosting the 1990 Goodwill Games and the APEC leaders conference in 1993, as well as through the worldwide popularity of grunge, a sound that had developed in Seattle's independent music scene. Another bid for worldwide attention\u2014hosting the World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 1999\u2014garnered visibility, but not in the way its sponsors desired, as related protest activity and police reactions to those protests overshadowed the conference itself.

Such suits are often combined with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) to ensure a supply of breathable air. Hazmat suits are used by firefighters, emergency medical technicians, paramedics, researchers, personnel responding to toxic spills, specialists cleaning up contaminated facilities, and workers in toxic environments.

        "prompt": "Title: Punjab,_Pakistan\n\nBackground: Punjab during Mahabharata times was known as Panchanada. Punjab was part of the Indus Valley Civilization, more than 4000 years ago. The main site in Punjab was the city of Harrapa. The Indus Valley Civilization spanned much of what is today Pakistan and eventually evolved into the Indo-Aryan civilisation. The Vedic civilisation flourished along the length of the Indus River. This civilisation shaped subsequent cultures in South Asia and Afghanistan. Although the archaeological site at Harappa was partially damaged in 1857 when engineers constructing the Lahore-Multan railroad used brick from the Harappa ruins for track ballast, an abundance of artefacts have nevertheless been found. Punjab was part of the great ancient empires including the Gandhara Mahajanapadas, Achaemenids, Macedonians, Mauryas, Kushans, Guptas, and Hindu Shahi. It also comprised the Gujar empire for a period of time, otherwise known as the Gurjara-Pratihara empire.

        "prompt": "Title: Literature\n\nBackground: Poetry is a form of literary art which uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, prosaic ostensible meaning. Poetry has traditionally been distinguished from prose by its being set in verse;[a] prose is cast in sentences, poetry in lines; the syntax of prose is dictated by meaning, whereas that of poetry is held across metre or the visual aspects of the poem. Prior to the nineteenth century, poetry was commonly understood to be something set in metrical lines; accordingly, in 1658 a definition of poetry is \"any kind of subject consisting of Rythm or Verses\". Possibly as a result of Aristotle's influence (his Poetics), \"poetry\" before the nineteenth century was usually less a technical designation for verse than a normative category of fictive or rhetorical art. As a form it may pre-date literacy, with the earliest works being composed within and sustained by an oral tradition; hence it constitutes the earliest example of literature.\n\nQ: The structure of poetry may have existed before what?\n\nA: literacy\n\nTitle: Athanasius_of_Alexandria\n\nBackground: The Arians no longer presented an unbroken front to their orthodox opponents. The Emperor Constantius, who had been the cause of so much trouble, died 4 November, 361 and was succeeded by Julian. The proclamation of the new prince's accession was the signal for a pagan outbreak against the still dominant Arian faction in Alexandria. George, the usurping Bishop, was flung into prison and murdered. An obscure presbyter of the name of Pistus was immediately chosen by the Arians to succeed him, when fresh news arrived that filled the orthodox party with hope. An edict had been put forth by Julian permitting the exiled bishops of the \"Galileans\" to return to their \"towns and provinces\". Athanasius received a summons from his own flock, and he accordingly re-entered his episcopal capitol on 22 February, 362.\n\nQ: Were the Arians united in their oppostion?\n\nA: The Arians no longer presented an unbroken front\n\nTitle: Prince Edward Islands\n\nBackground: Prince Edward Islands The Prince Edward Islands are two small islands in the sub-antarctic Indian Ocean that are part of South Africa. The islands are named Marion Island (named after Marc-Joseph Marion du Fresne) and Prince Edward Island (named after Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn). The islands in the group have been declared Special Nature Reserves under the South African Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act, No. 57 of 2003, and activities on the islands are therefore restricted to research and conservation management. Further protection was granted when the area was declared a \"Marine Protected Area\" in 2013. The\n\nQ: ['where is prince edward island?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Insect\n\nBackground: Insects have segmented bodies supported by exoskeletons, the hard outer covering made mostly of chitin. The segments of the body are organized into three distinctive but interconnected units, or tagmata: a head, a thorax and an abdomen. The head supports a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, and, if present, one to three simple eyes (or ocelli) and three sets of variously modified appendages that form the mouthparts. The thorax has six segmented legs\u2014one pair each for the prothorax, mesothorax and the metathorax segments making up the thorax\u2014and, none, two or four wings. The abdomen consists of eleven segments, though in a few species of insects, these segments may be fused together or reduced in size. The abdomen also contains most of the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive internal structures.:22\u201348 Considerable variation and many adaptations in the body parts of insects occur, especially wings, legs, antenna and mouthparts.\n\nQ: What kind of bodies to insects have?\n\nA: segmented bodies\n\nTitle: Oklahoma_City\n\nBackground: Oklahoma City is the capital and largest city of the state of Oklahoma. The county seat of Oklahoma County, the city ranks 27th among United States cities in population. The population grew following the 2010 Census, with the population estimated to have increased to 620,602 as of July 2014. As of 2014, the Oklahoma City metropolitan area had a population of 1,322,429, and the Oklahoma City-Shawnee Combined Statistical Area had a population of 1,459,758 (Chamber of Commerce) residents, making it Oklahoma's largest metropolitan area. Oklahoma City's city limits extend into Canadian, Cleveland, and Pottawatomie counties, though much of those areas outside of the core Oklahoma County area are suburban or rural (watershed). The city ranks as the eighth-largest city in the United States by land area (including consolidated city-counties; it is the largest city in the United States by land area whose government is not consolidated with that of a county or borough).\n\nQ: Which city is the largest in Oklahoma?\n\nA: Oklahoma City\n\nTitle: Census in Australia\n\nBackground: with Australia-wide data. The population of Australia was 2,250,194. At the time the Northern Territory was a territory of South Australia and had 3,451 people plus 6,346 Aboriginals in settled districts. Including its Northern Territory, South Australia had 286,211 people. The reported population of Western Australia did not include full-blood aborigines. The population of greater Melbourne was 282,947 and of Sydney was 224,939. In 1901, there were 3,773,801 people (1,977,928 males and 1,795,873 females) counted in Australia. Prior to Federation, each colony had been responsible for its own census collection. The census held during the first year of Federation, 1901,\n\nQ: ['what is the population of australia?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Nanjing\n\nBackground: In the 1950s after PRC was established by CPC, the government invested heavily in the city to build a series of state-owned heavy industries, as part of the national plan of rapid industrialization, converting it into a heavy industry production centre of East China. Overenthusiastic in building a \u201cworld-class\u201d industrial city, the government also made many disastrous mistakes during development, such as spending hundreds of millions of yuan to mine for non-existent coal, resulting in negative economic growth in the late 1960s. From 1960s to 1980s there were Five Pillar Industries, namely, electronics, cars, petrochemical, iron and steel, and power, each with big state-owned firms. After the Reform and Opening recovering market economy, the state-owned enterprises found themselves incapable of competing with efficient multinational firms and local private firms, hence were either mired in heavy debt or forced into bankruptcy or privatization and this resulted in large numbers of layoff workers who were technically not unemployed but effectively jobless.\n\nQ: What did the government build in Nanjing during the 1950's?\n\nA: a series of state-owned heavy industries\n\nTitle: The_Times\n\nBackground: In a 2009 national readership survey The Times was found to have the highest number of ABC1 25\u201344 readers and the largest numbers of readers in London of any of the \"quality\" papers.\n\nQ: In a 2009 national readership survey, what newspaper has the highest number of ABC1 25-44 readers?\n\nA: The Times\n\nTitle: Atom\n\nBackground: by producing the first statistical physics analysis of Brownian motion. French physicist Jean Perrin used Einstein's work to experimentally determine the mass and dimensions of atoms, thereby conclusively verifying Dalton's atomic theory. The physicist J.J. Thomson measured the mass of cathode rays, showing they were made of particles, but were around 1800 times lighter than the lightest atom, hydrogen. Therefore, they were not atoms, but a new particle, the first \"subatomic\" particle to be discovered, which he originally called \"\"corpuscle\"\" but was later named \"electron\", after particles postulated by George Johnstone Stoney in 1874. He also showed they were identical\n\nQ: ['what subatomic particle did jj thomson discover?']\n\nA:",

An approximation to such vacuum is a region with a gaseous pressure much less than atmospheric pressure. Physicists often discuss ideal test results that would occur in a perfect vacuum, which they sometimes simply call \"vacuum\" or free space, and use the term partial vacuum to refer to an actual imperfect vacuum as one might have in a laboratory or in space. In engineering and applied physics on the other hand, vacuum refers to any space in which the pressure is lower than atmospheric pressure.

        "prompt": "Title: Serbo-Croatian\n\nBackground: The Serbo-Croatian dialects differ not only in the question word they are named after, but also heavily in phonology, accentuation and intonation, case endings and tense system (morphology) and basic vocabulary. In the past, Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects were spoken on a much larger territory, but have been replaced by \u0160tokavian during the period of migrations caused by Ottoman Turkish conquest of the Balkans in the 15th and the 16th centuries. These migrations caused the koin\u00e9isation of the Shtokavian dialects, that used to form the West Shtokavian (more closer and transitional towards the neighbouring Chakavian and Kajkavian dialects) and East Shtokavian (transitional towards the Torlakian and the whole Bulgaro-Macedonian area) dialect bundles, and their subsequent spread at the expense of Chakavian and Kajkavian. As a result, \u0160tokavian now covers an area larger than all the other dialects combined, and continues to make its progress in the enclaves where non-literary dialects are still being spoken.\n\nQ: What has caused Stokavian to become more widely spoken?\n\nA: migrations caused by Ottoman Turkish conquest of the Balkans\n\nTitle: Hanover\n\nBackground: Some other popular sights are the Waterloo Column, the Laves House, the Wangenheim Palace, the Lower Saxony State Archives, the Hanover Playhouse, the Kr\u00f6pcke Clock, the Anzeiger Tower Block, the Administration Building of the NORD/LB, the Cupola Hall of the Congress Centre, the Lower Saxony Stock, the Ministry of Finance, the Garten Church, the Luther Church, the Gehry Tower (designed by the American architect Frank O.

The day after he died, a letter arrived for him from the Soviet government, giving him authorization to travel to Tuva. Later Feynman's daughter Michelle would realize this journey. Out of his enthusiastic interest in reaching Tuva came the phrase \"Tuva or Bust\" (also the title of a book about his efforts to get there), which was tossed about frequently amongst his circle of friends in hope that they, one day, could see it firsthand. The documentary movie, Genghis Blues, mentions some of his attempts to communicate with Tuva and chronicles the successful journey there by his friends. Responding to Hubert Humphrey's congratulation for his Nobel Prize, Feynman admitted to a long admiration for the then vice president.\n\nQ: When was Feynman allowed to go to Tuva?\n\nA: The day after he died\n\nTitle: McCarran International Airport\n\nBackground: McCarran International Airport McCarran International Airport is the primary commercial airport serving the Las Vegas Valley, a major metropolitan area in the U.S. state of Nevada.

Simultaneously, the growth and expansion of Yale University further affected the economic shift. Today, over half (56%) of the city's economy is now made up of services, in particular education and health care; Yale is the city's largest employer, followed by Yale \u2013 New Haven Hospital. Other large employers include St. Raphael Hospital, Smilow Cancer Hospital, Southern Connecticut State University, Assa Abloy Manufacturing, the Knights of Columbus headquarters, Higher One, Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Covidien and United Illuminating.

While 200,000 people participated, dealers disliked the promotion, the supply of computers was insufficient for demand, and many were returned in such a bad condition that they could no longer be sold. This marketing campaign caused CEO John Sculley to raise the price from US$1,995 to US$2,495 (about $5,200 when adjusted for inflation in 2010). The computer sold well, nonetheless, reportedly outselling the IBM PCjr which also began shipping early that year. By April 1984 the company sold 50,000 Macintoshes, and hoped for 70,000 by early May and almost 250,000 by the end of the year.\n\nQ: What did Apple allow potential buyers to take home and try for 24 hours?\n\nA: a Macintosh\n\nTitle: Mercer Ellington\n\nBackground: Ellington is president of the Duke Ellington Center for the Arts.

The eldest son, Garc\u00eda, became king of Le\u00f3n. The second son, Ordo\u00f1o, reigned in Galicia, while the third, Fruela, received Asturias with Oviedo as his capital. Alfonso died in Zamora, probably in 910. His former realm would be reunited when first Garc\u00eda died childless and Le\u00f3n passed to Ordo\u00f1o. He in turn died when his children were too young to ascend; Fruela became king of a reunited crown. His death the next year initiated a series of internecine struggles that led to unstable succession for over a century. It continued under that name[clarification needed] until incorporated into the Kingdom of Castile in 1230, after Ferdinand III became joint king of the two kingdoms. This was done to avoid dynastic feuds and to maintain the Christian Kingdoms strong enough to prevent complete Muslim take over of the Iberian Peninsula and to further the Reconquista of Iberia by Christian armies.\n\nQ: In which year was the Kingdom of Castile formed?\n\nA: 1230\n\nTitle: Alsace\n\nBackground: \"Alsatia\", the Latin form of Alsace's name, has long ago entered the English language with the specialized meaning of \"a lawless place\" or \"a place under no jurisdiction\" - since Alsace was conceived by English people to be such. It was used into the 20th century as a term for a ramshackle marketplace, \"protected by ancient custom and the independence of their patrons\". As of 2007, the word is still in use among the English and Australian judiciaries with the meaning of a place where the law cannot reach: \"In setting up the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the state has set out to create an Alsatia - a region of executive action free of judicial oversight,\" Lord Justice Sedley in UMBS v SOCA 2007.\n\nQ: What was the meaning or term used for Aslace that was used by english people in the 20th century?\n\nA: ramshackle marketplace\n\nTitle: 2018 World Series\n\nBackground: Series (4\u20131): Boston Red Sox beat Los Angeles Dodgers. The World Series was televised nationally by Fox for the 19th straight year. Joe Buck was the play-by-play announcer, with John Smoltz as the color commentator.

Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire, insects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay, which, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk. The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages, however, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely to its relative age and position.\n\nQ: Decay can spread to all of what part of a tree?\n\nA: the trunk\n\nTitle: Roman_Republic\n\nBackground: In the final decades of this era many plebeians grew poorer. The long military campaigns had forced citizens to leave their farms to fight, while their farms fell into disrepair. The landed aristocracy began buying bankrupted farms at discounted prices. As commodity prices fell, many farmers could no longer operate their farms at a profit. The result was the ultimate bankruptcy of countless farmers. Masses of unemployed plebeians soon began to flood into Rome, and thus into the ranks of the legislative assemblies. Their poverty usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered them the most. A new culture of dependency was emerging, in which citizens would look to any populist leader for relief.\n\nQ: Who had bought the now bankrupt farms?\n\nA: landed aristocracy\n\nTitle: Thyroid\n\nBackground: tail, and fins of tadpoles.

The city is noted for its history, culture, architecture and gastronomy, playing an important role throughout much of its existence; it is over 2,700 years old. Palermo is located in the northwest of the island of Sicily, right by the Gulf of Palermo in the Tyrrhenian Sea.\n\nQ: For what is Palermo known?\n\nA: history, culture, architecture and gastronomy\n\nTitle: Pope_Paul_VI\n\nBackground: During Vatican II, the Council Fathers avoided statements which might anger Christians of other faiths.[page needed] Cardinal Augustin Bea, the President of the Christian Unity Secretariat, always had the full support of Paul VI in his attempts to ensure that the Council language was friendly and open to the sensitivities of Protestant and Orthodox Churches, whom he had invited to all sessions at the request of Pope John XXIII. Bea also was strongly involved in the passage of Nostra aetate, which regulates the Church's relations with the Jewish faith and members of other religions.[d]\n\nQ: Who insisted that Protestant and Orthodox Christians be invited to all Counsel meetings?\n\nA: Pope John XXIII\n\nTitle: Oklahoma\n\nBackground: all-Indian state named \"Sequoyah\" failed but the Sequoyah Statehood Convention of 1905 eventually laid the groundwork for the Oklahoma Statehood Convention, which took place two years later. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma was established as the 46th state in the Union. The new state became a focal point for the emerging oil industry, as discoveries of oil pools prompted towns to grow rapidly in population and wealth. Tulsa eventually became known as the \"Oil Capital of the World\" for most of the 20th century and oil investments fueled much of the state's early economy.

The madaris also resemble colleges, where people take evening classes and reside in dormitories. An important function of the madaris is to admit orphans and poor children in order to provide them with education and training. Madaris may enroll female students; however, they study separately from the men.[citation needed]\n\nQ: In what ways are madaris similar to western colleges?\n\nA: people take evening classes and reside in dormitories\n\nTitle: Law_of_the_United_States\n\nBackground: However, it is important to understand that despite the presence of reception statutes, much of contemporary American common law has diverged significantly from English common law. The reason is that although the courts of the various Commonwealth nations are often influenced by each other's rulings, American courts rarely follow post-Revolution Commonwealth rulings unless there is no American ruling on point, the facts and law at issue are nearly identical, and the reasoning is strongly persuasive.\n\nQ: When would American courts follow post-revolution commonwealth rulings?\n\nA: there is no American ruling on point\n\nTitle: National Hockey League rivalries\n\nBackground: in 1938. The New York Americans and New York Rangers had a rivalry that existed between 1926 (When the Rangers became an NHL team) and 1942 (When the Americans folded). The two teams played in Madison Square Garden; however the Americans were the first NHL team to occupy the stadium. Even though the Garden had promised team owner and bootlegger Bill Dwyer the Americans would be the sole hockey team in New York, fan popularity and ticket sales allowed the Rangers to come into existence, thus the rivalry was born.

However, many independent Chicago-based record labels were making appearances on the Dance Chart with their releases.

The emergence of Todd Terry, a pioneer of the genre, was important in America.

The two began dating and became engaged just six months later in May 2000, while Laine was still a senior at Marina High School in Huntington Beach, California.

        "prompt": "Title: London\n\nBackground: In the latter half of the 19th century the locale of South Kensington was developed as \"Albertopolis\", a cultural and scientific quarter. Three major national museums are there: the Victoria and Albert Museum (for the applied arts), the Natural History Museum and the Science Museum. The National Portrait Gallery was founded in 1856 to house depictions of figures from British history; its holdings now comprise the world's most extensive collection of portraits. The national gallery of British art is at Tate Britain, originally established as an annexe of the National Gallery in 1897. The Tate Gallery, as it was formerly known, also became a major centre for modern art; in 2000 this collection moved to Tate Modern, a new gallery housed in the former Bankside Power Station.\n\nQ: What cultural and scientific hub was named in honor of Queen Victoria's husband?\n\nA: Albertopolis\n\nTitle: Humanism\n\nBackground: The humanists' close study of Latin literary texts soon enabled them to discern historical differences in the writing styles of different periods. By analogy with what they saw as decline of Latin, they applied the principle of ad fontes, or back to the sources, across broad areas of learning, seeking out manuscripts of Patristic literature as well as pagan authors. In 1439, while employed in Naples at the court of Alfonso V of Aragon (at the time engaged in a dispute with the Papal States) the humanist Lorenzo Valla used stylistic textual analysis, now called philology, to prove that the Donation of Constantine, which purported to confer temporal powers on the Pope of Rome, was an 8th-century forgery. For the next 70 years, however, neither Valla nor any of his contemporaries thought to apply the techniques of philology to other controversial manuscripts in this way. Instead, after the fall of the Byzantine Empire to the Turks in 1453, which brought a flood of Greek Orthodox refugees to Italy, humanist scholars increasingly turned to the study of Neoplatonism and Hermeticism, hoping to bridge the differences between the Greek and Roman Churches, and even between Christianity itself and the non-Christian world. The refugees brought with them Greek manuscripts, not only of Plato and Aristotle, but also of the Christian Gospels, previously unavailable in the Latin West.\n\nQ: What caused a large migration of Greek refuges in the 1450s?\n\nA: Byzantine Empire\n\nTitle: Languages of Afghanistan\n\nBackground: in the region. Languages of Afghanistan Afghanistan is a multilingual country in which two languages \u2013 Dari and Pashto \u2013 are both official and most widely spoken. Dari is the official name of the Persian language in Afghanistan. It is often referred to as the \"Afghan Persian\".

        "prompt": "Title: Tucson,_Arizona\n\nBackground: Both the council members and the mayor serve four-year terms; none face term limits. Council members are nominated by their wards via a ward-level primary held in September. The top vote-earners from each party then compete at-large for their ward's seat on the November ballot. In other words, on election day the whole city votes on all the council races up for that year. Council elections are severed: Wards 1, 2, and 4 (as well as the mayor) are up for election in the same year (most recently 2011), while Wards 3, 5, and 6 share another year (most recently 2013).\n\nQ: Which wards elect city council members in the same year as the mayor?\n\nA: 1, 2, and 4\n\nTitle: 2008_Summer_Olympics_torch_relay\n\nBackground: \n Australia: The event was held in Canberra, Australian Capital Territory on April 24, and covered around 16 km of Canberra's central areas, from Reconciliation Place to Commonwealth Park. Upon its arrival in Canberra, the Olympic flame was presented by Chinese officials to local Aboriginal elder Agnes Shea, of the Ngunnawal people. She, in turn, offered them a message stick, as a gift of peace and welcome. Hundreds of pro-Tibet protesters and thousands of Chinese students reportedly attended. Demonstrators and counter-demonstrators were kept apart by the Australian Federal Police. Preparations for the event were marred by a disagreement over the role of the Chinese flame attendants, with Australian and Chinese officials arguing publicly over their function and prerogatives during a press conference.\n\nQ: How many kilometers was the route in Australia?\n\nA: 16\n\nTitle: Otto Liman von Sanders\n\nBackground: in Europe, the Ottoman leaders agreed to form an alliance with Germany against Russia, although it did not require them to undertake military action, and on 31 October 1914, the Ottoman Empire officially entered the war on the side of the Central Powers. Britain and France declared war on it on 5 November, and the Ottomans declared a \"jihad\" (holy war) later that month, but the call for jihad failed as many of the Arab nationalists formed an alliance with the British (which led to the Arab Revolt).

The most common symptom is chest pain or discomfort which may travel into the shoulder, arm, back, neck, or jaw. Often it is in the center or left side of the chest and lasts for more than a few minutes. The discomfort may occasionally feel like heartburn. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, nausea, feeling faint, a cold sweat, or feeling tired. About 30% of people have atypical symptoms, with women more likely than men to present atypically. Among those over 75 years old, about 5% have had an MI with little or no history of symptoms. An MI may cause heart failure, an irregular heartbeat, or cardiac arrest.\n\nQ: What is the most common symptom of MI?\n\nA: chest pain or discomfort\n\nTitle: Buddhism\n\nBackground: Bruce Matthews notes that there is no cohesive presentation of karma in the Sutta Pitaka, which may mean that the doctrine was incidental to the main perspective of early Buddhist soteriology. Schmithausen is a notable scholar who has questioned whether karma already played a role in the theory of rebirth of earliest Buddhism.[page needed][note 32] According to Vetter, \"the Buddha at first sought \"the deathless\" (amata/amrta), which is concerned with the here and now. According to Vetter, only after this realization did he become acquainted with the doctrine of rebirth.\" Bronkhorst disagrees, and concludes that the Buddha \"introduced a concept of karma that differed considerably from the commonly held views of his time.\" According to Bronkhorst, not physical and mental activities as such were seen as responsible for rebirth, but intentions and desire.\n\nQ: According the Bronkhorst, intentions and desire are responsible for what?\n\nA: rebirth\n\nTitle: Supernova nucleosynthesis\n\nBackground: abundances of the elements. A supernova is a violent explosion of a star that occurs under two principal scenarios. The first is that a white dwarf star, which is the remnant of a low-mass star that has exhausted its nuclear fuel, undergoes a thermonuclear explosion after its mass is increased beyond its Chandrasekhar limit by accreting nuclear-fuel mass from a more diffuse companion star (usually a red giant) with which it is in binary orbit.

Plato advocated a benevolent monarchy ruled by an idealized philosopher king, who was above the law. Plato nevertheless hoped that the best men would be good at respecting established laws, explaining that \"Where the law is subject to some other authority and has none of its own, the collapse of the state, in my view, is not far off; but if law is the master of the government and the government is its slave, then the situation is full of promise and men enjoy all the blessings that the gods shower on a state.\" More than Plato attempted to do, Aristotle flatly opposed letting the highest officials wield power beyond guarding and serving the laws.

In 2006, the world's largest solar power plant at that date, the Moura Photovoltaic Power Station, began operating near Moura, in the south, while the world's first commercial wave power farm, the Agu\u00e7adoura Wave Farm, opened in the Norte region (2008). By the end of 2006, 66% of the country's electrical production was from coal and fuel power plants, while 29% were derived from hydroelectric dams, and 6% by wind energy.\n\nQ: Where was Moura Photovoltaic Power Station located?\n\nA: Moura, in the south\n\nTitle: Australia (continent)\n\nBackground: of the continent of Australia, but of the separate, submerged continent of Zealandia.

The term Oceania is often used to denote the region encompassing the Australian continent, Zealandia and various islands in the Pacific Ocean that are not included in the seven-continent model. Papua New Guinea, a country within the continent, is one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse countries in the world.

        "prompt": "Title: Avicenna\n\nBackground: While he was imprisoned in the castle of Fardajan near Hamadhan, Avicenna wrote his famous \"Floating Man\" \u2013 literally falling man \u2013 thought experiment to demonstrate human self-awareness and the substantiality and immateriality of the soul. Avicenna believed his \"Floating Man\" thought experiment demonstrated that the soul is a substance, and claimed humans cannot doubt their own consciousness, even in a situation that prevents all sensory data input. The thought experiment told its readers to imagine themselves created all at once while suspended in the air, isolated from all sensations, which includes no sensory contact with even their own bodies. He argued that, in this scenario, one would still have self-consciousness. Because it is conceivable that a person, suspended in air while cut off from sense experience, would still be capable of determining his own existence, the thought experiment points to the conclusions that the soul is a perfection, independent of the body, and an immaterial substance. The conceivability of this \"Floating Man\" indicates that the soul is perceived intellectually, which entails the soul's separateness from the body. Avicenna referred to the living human intelligence, particularly the active intellect, which he believed to be the hypostasis by which God communicates truth to the human mind and imparts order and intelligibility to nature. Following is an English translation of the argument:\n\nQ: What did Avicenna write while he was imprisoned?\n\nA: \"Floating Man\"\n\nTitle: Zinc\n\nBackground: Zinc deficiency is crop plants' most common micronutrient deficiency; it is particularly common in high-pH soils. Zinc-deficient soil is cultivated in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India, a third of China, and most of Western Australia, and substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas. Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease. Zinc is primarily added to the soil through the weathering of rocks, but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion, mine waste, phosphate fertilizers, pesticide (zinc phosphide), limestone, manure, sewage sludge, and particles from galvanized surfaces. Excess zinc is toxic to plants, although zinc toxicity is far less widespread.\n\nQ: How is zinc primarily added to soil?\n\nA: weathering of rocks\n\nTitle: Decius Wade\n\nBackground: in a law firm. Montana became a state on November 8, 1889, and from 1889 until 1895, Wade served as one of three Code Commissioners who were tasked with the codification of Montana law. The Commission produced four legal codes\u2014Civil, Political, Procedure and Penal\u2014to replace the volumes of session laws. These were reported to the Montana Legislature in 1892, though no action was taken at first due to political reasons as well as concerns of uncertainty and inconsistency inherent in codes.

International crises arose, such as the Berlin Blockade (1948\u20131949), the Korean War (1950\u20131953), the Berlin Crisis of 1961, the Vietnam War (1959\u20131975), the Cuban Missile Crisis (1962), the Soviet war in Afghanistan (1979\u20131989) and NATO exercises in November 1983. There were also periods of reduced tension as both sides sought d\u00e9tente.

Most damaging of all was the fall of Singapore, which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar. The realisation that Britain could not defend its entire empire pushed Australia and New Zealand, which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces, into closer ties with the United States.

Nasser is played by Ahmed Zaki in Mohamed Fadel's 1996 Nasser 56. The film set the Egyptian box office record at the time, and focused on Nasser during the Suez Crisis. It is also considered a milestone in Egyptian and Arab cinema as the first film to dramatize the role of a modern-day Arab leader.

Gautama underwent prolonged fasting, breath-holding, and exposure to pain. He almost starved himself to death in the process. He realized that he had taken this kind of practice to its limit, and had not put an end to suffering. So in a pivotal moment he accepted milk and rice from a village girl and changed his approach. He devoted himself to anapanasati meditation, through which he discovered what Buddhists call the Middle Way (Skt. madhyam\u0101-pratipad): a path of moderation between the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification.[web 2][web 3]\n\nQ: What is the path of moderation between the extremes of self-indulgence and self-mortification called?\n\nA: the Middle Way\n\nTitle: Caliente, Nevada\n\nBackground: Caliente, Nevada Caliente , formerly known as Culverwell and Calientes, is a city in Lincoln County, Nevada, United States.

Caliente was founded in 1901 on Culverwell Ranch (or just Culverwell), built on land owned by William and Charles Culverwell.

An estimated 40% of the total 400,000 Africans transported and sold as slaves into North America are estimated to have landed at Sullivan's Island, just off the port of Charles Town; it is described as a \"hellish Ellis Island of sorts .... Today nothing commemorates that ugly fact but a simple bench, established by the author Toni Morrison using private funds.\"\n\nQ: Which African coast did many slaves that were sold in Charles Town come from?\n\nA: Windward Coast\n\nTitle: Royal_assent\n\nBackground: Under the Royal Assent Act 1967, royal assent can be granted by the sovereign in writing, by means of letters patent, that are presented to the presiding officer of each house of parliament. Then, the presiding officer makes a formal, but simple statement to the house, acquainting each house that royal assent has been granted to the acts mentioned. Thus, unlike the granting of royal assent by the monarch in person or by Royal Commissioners, the method created by the Royal Assent Act 1967 does not require both houses to meet jointly for the purpose of receiving the notice of royal assent. The standard text of the letters patent is set out in The Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules) Order 1992, with minor amendments in 2000. In practice this remains the standard method, a fact that is belied by the wording of the letters patent for the appointment of the Royal Commissioners and by the wording of the letters patent for the granting of royal assent in writing under the 1967 Act (\"... And forasmuch as We cannot at this time be present in the Higher House of Our said Parliament being the accustomed place for giving Our Royal Assent...\").\n\nQ: Which document formats the letters patent?\n\nA: The Crown Office (Forms and Proclamations Rules) Order 1992\n\nTitle: Higgins (dog)\n\nBackground: was facilitated by Frank Inn, who also trained Arnold Ziffel (the pig) and all of the other animals used on \"The Beverly Hillbillies\", \"Petticoat Junction\", \"Green Acres\", and \"The Waltons\" TV series. His on-set assistant trainers included Gerry Warshauer and Karl Miller. As an actor, Higgins first came to national attention as the uncredited dog who played the character of \"Dog\" on the television sitcom \"Petticoat Junction\" for six of the show's seven seasons, from 1964 to 1970, appearing in 149 episodes.

According to the Records of the Founding Emperor, the Hongwu Emperor issued an edict granting the title \"Initiation State Master\" to Sagya Gyaincain, while the latter sent envoys to the Ming court to hand over his jade seal of authority along with tribute of colored silk and satin, statues of the Buddha, Buddhist scriptures, and sarira.\n\nQ: Who suggested to the emperor that an official title be granted to second Phagmodru ruler?\n\nA: the Ming officer of Hezhou\n\nTitle: North_Carolina\n\nBackground: North Carolina's party loyalties have undergone a series of important shifts in the last few years: While the 2010 midterms saw Tar Heel voters elect a bicameral Republican majority legislature for the first time in over a century, North Carolina has also become a Southern swing state in presidential races. Since Southern Democrat Jimmy Carter's comfortable victory in the state in 1976, the state had consistently leaned Republican in presidential elections until Democrat Barack Obama narrowly won the state in 2008. In the 1990s, Democrat Bill Clinton came within a point of winning the state in 1992 and also only narrowly lost the state in 1996. In the early 2000s, Republican George W. Bush easily won the state by over 12 points, but by 2008, demographic shifts, population growth, and increased liberalization in heavily populated areas such as the Research Triangle, Charlotte, Greensboro, Winston-Salem, Fayetteville, and Asheville, propelled Barack Obama to victory in North Carolina, the first Democrat to win the state since 1976. In 2012, North Carolina was again considered a competitive swing state, with the Democrats even holding their 2012 Democratic National Convention in Charlotte. However, Republican Mitt Romney ultimately eked out a 2-point win in North Carolina, the only 2012 swing state that Obama lost, and one of only two states (along with Indiana) to flip from Obama in 2008 to the GOP in 2012.\n\nQ: North carolina voters have leaned republican since what year?\n\nA: 1976\n\nTitle: Caribbean\n\nBackground: C (77 F to 90 F) between the wet and dry seasons.

        "prompt": "Title: Montevideo\n\nBackground: The Palacio Taranco is located in front of the Plaza Zabala, in the heart of Ciudad Vieja. It was erected in the early 20th century as the residence of the Ortiz Taranco brothers on the ruins of Montevideo's first theatre (of 1793), during a period in which the architectural style was influenced by French architecture. The palace was designed by French architects Charles Louis Girault and Jules Chifflot Le\u00f3n who also designed the Petit Palais and the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. It passed to the city from the heirs of the Tarancos in 1943, along with its precious collection of Uruguayan furniture and draperies and was deemed by the city as an ideal place for a museum; in 1972 it became the Museum of Decorative Arts of Montevideo and in 1975 it became a National Heritage Site. The Decorative Arts Museum has an important collection of European paintings and decorative arts, ancient Greek and Roman art and Islamic ceramics of the 10th\u201318th century from the area of present-day Iran. The palace is often used as a meeting place by the Uruguayan government.\n\nQ: When was the Palacio Taranco erected?\n\nA: early 20th century\n\nTitle: Bacteria\n\nBackground: Bacteria do not have a membrane-bound nucleus, and their genetic material is typically a single circular DNA chromosome located in the cytoplasm in an irregularly shaped body called the nucleoid. The nucleoid contains the chromosome with its associated proteins and RNA. The phylum Planctomycetes and candidate phylum Poribacteria may be exceptions to the general absence of internal membranes in bacteria, because they appear to have a double membrane around their nucleoids and contain other membrane-bound cellular structures. Like all living organisms, bacteria contain ribosomes, often grouped in chains called polyribosomes, for the production of proteins, but the structure of the bacterial ribosome is different from that of eukaryotes and Archaea. Bacterial ribosomes have a sedimentation rate of 70S (measured in Svedberg units): their subunits have rates of 30S and 50S. Some antibiotics bind specifically to 70S ribosomes and inhibit bacterial protein synthesis. Those antibiotics kill bacteria without affecting the larger 80S ribosomes of eukaryotic cells and without harming the host.\n\nQ: Where is DNA chromosome of bacteria located?\n\nA: in the cytoplasm\n\nTitle: Scientist\n\nBackground: and pursued through a unique method, was essentially in place.

In 1922, she was appointed a member of the International Commission on Intellectual Co-operation by the Council of the League of Nations.

Truman and Acheson discussed a U.S. invasion response and agreed that the United States was obligated to act, paralleling the North Korean invasion with Adolf Hitler's aggressions in the 1930s, with the conclusion being that the mistake of appeasement must not be repeated. Several U.S. industries were mobilized to supply materials, labor, capital, production facilities, and other services necessary to support the military objectives of the Korean War. However, President Truman later acknowledged that he believed fighting the invasion was essential to the American goal of the global containment of communism as outlined in the National Security Council Report 68 (NSC-68) (declassified in 1975):\n\nQ: The US involvement in the Korean War was important to achieving what goal?\n\nA: the global containment of communism\n\nTitle: Treaty\n\nBackground: The Supreme Court ruled in the Head Money Cases that \"treaties\" do not have a privileged position over Acts of Congress and can be repealed or modified (for the purposes of U.S. law) by any subsequent Act of Congress, just like with any other regular law.

The cohort was therefore a much larger unit than the earlier maniple sub-unit, and was divided into six centuries of 80 men each. Each century was separated further into 10 \"tent groups\" of 8 men each. The cavalry troops were used as scouts and dispatch riders rather than battlefield cavalry.

Conjugation, in the much-studied E. coli system is determined by plasmid genes, and is an adaptation for transferring copies of the plasmid from one bacterial host to another. It is seldom that a conjugative plasmid integrates into the host bacterial chromosome, and subsequently transfers part of the host bacterial DNA to another bacterium.

        "prompt": "Title: The_Blitz\n\nBackground: The deliberate separation of the Luftwaffe from the rest of the military structure encouraged the emergence of a major \"communications gap\" between Hitler and the Luftwaffe, which other factors helped to exacerbate. For one thing, G\u00f6ring's fear of Hitler led him to falsify or misrepresent what information was available in the direction of an uncritical and over-optimistic interpretation of air strength. When G\u00f6ring decided against continuing Wever's original heavy bomber programme in 1937, the Reichsmarschall's own explanation was that Hitler wanted to know only how many bombers there were, not how many engines each had. In July 1939, G\u00f6ring arranged a display of the Luftwaffe's most advanced equipment at Rechlin, to give the impression the air force was more prepared for a strategic air war than was actually the case.\n\nQ: What did Goring do because of his fear of Hitler?\n\nA: misrepresent what information\n\nTitle: Multiracial_American\n\nBackground: Laws dating from 17th-century colonial America defined children of African slave mothers as taking the status of their mothers, and born into slavery regardless of the race or status of the father, under partus sequitur ventrem. The association of slavery with a \"race\" led to slavery as a racial caste. But, most families of free people of color formed in Virginia before the American Revolution were the descendants of unions between white women and African men, who frequently worked and lived together in the looser conditions of the early colonial period. While interracial marriage was later prohibited, white men frequently took sexual advantage of slave women, and numerous generations of multiracial children were born. By the late 1800s it had become common among African Americans to use passing to gain educational opportunities as did the first African-American graduate of Vassar College Anita Florence Hemmings. Some 19th-century categorization schemes defined people by proportion of African ancestry: a person whose parents were black and white was classified as mulatto, with one black grandparent and three white as quadroon, and with one black great-grandparent and the remainder white as octoroon. The latter categories remained within an overall black or colored category, but before the Civil War, in Virginia and some other states, a person of one-eighth or less black ancestry was legally white. Some members of these categories passed temporarily or permanently as white.\n\nQ: Who was the first African American to gradute from Vassar College?\n\nA: Anita Florence Hemmings\n\nTitle: National qualifications frameworks in the United Kingdom\n\nBackground: level descriptors for master's degrees and doctoral degrees, while maintaining separate descriptors for lower level qualifications. The Qualifications and Credit Framework was used from 2008 until 2015 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It replaced the National Qualifications Framework (NQF; see below) and was replaced in turn by the Regulated Qualifications Framework (RQF). It used the same levels as the (post 2004) NQF and the current RQF, but differed from the NQF in that in addition to qualifications being assigned a level they were assigned a credit value, indicating their size. The QCF had prescriptive rules on qualification design and\n\nQ: [\"what nqf level is a master's degree?\"]\n\nA:",

According to 2014 census, around 40% of the population of Iran are Internet users. Iran ranks 24th among countries by number of Internet users. According to the statistics provided by the web information company of Alexa, Google Search and Yahoo! are the most used search engines in Iran. Over 80% of the users of Telegram, a cloud-based instant messaging service, are from Iran. Instagram is the most popular online social networking service in Iran. Direct access to Facebook has been blocked in Iran since the 2009 Iranian presidential election protests, due to organization of the opposition movements on the website; but however, Facebook has around 12 to 17 million users in Iran who are using virtual private networks and proxy servers to access the website. Around 90% of Iran's e-commerce takes place on the Iranian online store of Digikala, which has around 750,000 visitors per day and more than 2.3 million subscribers.

Twins can be either \"monozygotic\" (\"identical\"), meaning that they develop from one zygote, which splits and forms two embryos, or \"dizygotic\" (\"fraternal\"), meaning that each twin develops from a separate egg and each egg is fertilized by its own sperm cell. In contrast, a fetus that develops alone in the womb is called a \"singleton\", and the general term for one offspring of a multiple birth is \"multiple\". Non-related look-alikes whose resemblance parallels that of twins are referred to as doppelgangers. The human twin birth rate in the United States\n\nQ: ['what are the two types of twins?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Switzerland\n\nBackground: The cuisine of Switzerland is multifaceted. While some dishes such as fondue, raclette or r\u00f6sti are omnipresent through the country, each region developed its own gastronomy according to the differences of climate and languages.  Traditional Swiss cuisine uses ingredients similar to those in other European countries, as well as unique dairy products and cheeses such as Gruy\u00e8re or Emmental, produced in the valleys of Gruy\u00e8res and Emmental. The number of fine-dining establishments is high, particularly in western Switzerland.\n\nQ: How do the ingredients of traditional Swiss cuisine compare to that of other European countries?\n\nA: similar\n\nTitle: Friedrich_Hayek\n\nBackground: In 1950, Hayek left the London School of Economics for the University of Chicago, where he became a professor in the Committee on Social Thought. Hayek's salary was funded not by the university, but by an outside foundation. University of Chicago President Robert Hutchins was in the midst of a war with the U. of Chicago faculty over departmental autonomy and control, and Hayek got caught in the middle of that battle. Hutchins had been attempting to force all departments to adopt the neo-Thomist Great Books program of Mortimer Adler, and the U. of Chicago economists were sick of Hutchins' meddling. As the result the Economics department rejected Hutchins' pressure to hire Hayek, and Hayek became a part of the new Committee on Social Thought.\n\nQ: What was the cause for the feud between Robert Hutchins and faculty?\n\nA: departmental autonomy and control\n\nTitle: Thermometer\n\nBackground: in a body made of material that is completely opaque and poorly reflective, when it has reached thermodynamic equilibrium, as a function of absolute thermodynamic temperature alone. A small enough hole in the wall of the cavity emits near enough blackbody radiation of which the spectral radiance can be precisely measured. The walls of the cavity, provided they are completely opaque and poorly reflective, can be of any material indifferently. This provides a well-reproducible absolute thermometer over a very wide range of temperatures, able to measure the absolute temperature of a body inside the cavity. A thermometer is called primary\n\nQ: ['what is a thermometer?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Spectre_(2015_film)\n\nBackground: Despite being an original story, Spectre draws on Ian Fleming's source material, most notably in the character of Franz Oberhauser, played by Christoph Waltz. Oberhauser shares his name with Hannes Oberhauser, a background character in the short story \"Octopussy\" from the Octopussy and The Living Daylights collection, and who is named in the film as having been a temporary legal guardian of a young Bond in 1983. Similarly, Charmian Bond is shown to have been his full-time guardian, observing the back story established by Fleming. With the acquisition of the rights to Spectre and its associated characters, screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade revealed that the film would provide a minor retcon to the continuity of the previous films, with the Quantum organisation alluded to in Casino Royale and introduced in Quantum of Solace reimagined as a division within Spectre rather than an independent organisation.\n\nQ: In what year was Hannes Oberhauser identified as a guardian of James Bond?\n\nA: 1983\n\nTitle: Antenna_(radio)\n\nBackground: An electromagnetic wave refractor in some aperture antennas is a component which due to its shape and position functions to selectively delay or advance portions of the electromagnetic wavefront passing through it. The refractor alters the spatial characteristics of the wave on one side relative to the other side. It can, for instance, bring the wave to a focus or alter the wave front in other ways, generally in order to maximize the directivity of the antenna system. This is the radio equivalent of an optical lens.\n\nQ: A refractor can be compared to what type of viewing?\n\nA: optical lens\n\nTitle: Greek alphabet\n\nBackground: Greek alphabet The Greek alphabet has been used to write the Greek language since the late ninth or early eighth century BC. It is derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet, and was the first alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants. In Archaic and early Classical times, the Greek alphabet existed in many different local variants, but, by the end of the fourth century BC, the Eucleidean alphabet, with twenty-four letters, ordered from alpha to omega, had become standard and it is this version that is still used to write Greek today.

Some investigators have argued that it is this neuroticism that causes acute pain to turn chronic, but clinical evidence points the other way, to chronic pain causing neuroticism. When long-term pain is relieved by therapeutic intervention, scores on the neurotic triad and anxiety fall, often to normal levels. Self-esteem, often low in chronic pain patients, also shows improvement once pain has resolved.\n\nQ: When people have long-term pain, what do they frequently display?\n\nA: psychological disturbance\n\nTitle: Boston\n\nBackground: Boston is an intellectual, technological, and political center but has lost some important regional institutions, including the acquisition of The Boston Globe by The New York Times, and the loss to mergers and acquisitions of local financial institutions such as FleetBoston Financial, which was acquired by Charlotte-based Bank of America in 2004. Boston-based department stores Jordan Marsh and Filene's have both been merged into the Cincinnati\u2013based Macy's. Boston has experienced gentrification in the latter half of the 20th century, with housing prices increasing sharply since the 1990s. Living expenses have risen, and Boston has one of the highest costs of living in the United States, and was ranked the 129th most expensive major city in the world in a 2011 survey of 214 cities.

Eric Zorn of the Chicago Tribune praises Lee's \"rich use of language\" but writes that the central lesson is that \"courage isn't always flashy, isn't always enough, but is always in style\". Jane Sullivan in the Sydney Morning Herald agrees, stating that the book \"still rouses fresh and horrified indignation\" as it examines morality, a topic that has recently become unfashionable. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie writing in The Guardian states that Lee, rare among American novelists, writes with \"a fiercely progressive ink, in which there is nothing inevitable about racism and its very foundation is open to question\", comparing her to William Faulkner, who wrote about racism as an inevitability. Literary critic Rosemary Goring in Scotland's The Herald notes the connections between Lee and Jane Austen, stating the book's central theme, that \"one\u2019s moral convictions are worth fighting for, even at the risk of being reviled\" is eloquently discussed.\n\nQ: Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie vompared Lee to whom?\n\nA: William Faulkner\n\nTitle: Antenna_(radio)\n\nBackground: Both the vertical and dipole antennas are simple in construction and relatively inexpensive. The dipole antenna, which is the basis for most antenna designs, is a balanced component, with equal but opposite voltages and currents applied at its two terminals through a balanced transmission line (or to a coaxial transmission line through a so-called balun). The vertical antenna, on the other hand, is a monopole antenna. It is typically connected to the inner conductor of a coaxial transmission line (or a matching network); the shield of the transmission line is connected to ground. In this way, the ground (or any large conductive surface) plays the role of the second conductor of a dipole, thereby forming a complete circuit. Since monopole antennas rely on a conductive ground, a so-called grounding structure may be employed to provide a better ground contact to the earth or which itself acts as a ground plane to perform that function regardless of (or in absence of) an actual contact with the earth.\n\nQ: What is used to close the circuit of a dipole antenna?\n\nA: large conductive surface\n\nTitle: Second metacarpal bone\n\nBackground: Second metacarpal bone The second metacarpal bone (metacarpal bone of the index finger) is the longest, and its base the largest, of all the metacarpal bones. Its base is prolonged upward and medialward, forming a prominent ridge. It presents four articular facets, three on the upper surface and one on the ulnar side: The extensor carpi radialis longus muscle is inserted on the dorsal surface and the flexor carpi radialis muscle on the volar surface of the base. The shaft gives origin to the first palmar interosseus and the first and second dorsal interossei. This bone is often the most\n\nQ: ['what is the longest bone in the human body?']\n\nA:",

        "prompt": "Title: Idealism\n\nBackground: Any philosophy that assigns crucial importance to the ideal or spiritual realm in its account of human existence may be termed \"idealist\". Metaphysical idealism is an ontological doctrine that holds that reality itself is incorporeal or experiential at its core. Beyond this, idealists disagree on which aspects of the mental are more basic. Platonic idealism affirms that abstractions are more basic to reality than the things we perceive, while subjective idealists and phenomenalists tend to privilege sensory experience over abstract reasoning. Epistemological idealism is the view that reality can only be known through ideas, that only psychological experience can be apprehended by the mind.\n\nQ: What is the term used for philosophies that consider the spiritual to be of paramount importance?\n\nA: idealist\n\nTitle: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric_Chopin\n\nBackground: Chopin's relations with Sand were soured in 1846 by problems involving her daughter Solange and Solange's fianc\u00e9, the young fortune-hunting sculptor Auguste Cl\u00e9singer. The composer frequently took Solange's side in quarrels with her mother; he also faced jealousy from Sand's son Maurice. Chopin was utterly indifferent to Sand's radical political pursuits, while Sand looked on his society friends with disdain. As the composer's illness progressed, Sand had become less of a lover and more of a nurse to Chopin, whom she called her \"third child\". In letters to third parties, she vented her impatience, referring to him as a \"child,\" a \"little angel\", a \"sufferer\" and a \"beloved little corpse.\" In 1847 Sand published her novel Lucrezia Floriani, whose main characters\u2014a rich actress and a prince in weak health\u2014could be interpreted as Sand and Chopin; the story was uncomplimentary to Chopin, who could not have missed the allusions as he helped Sand correct the printer's galleys.

The mosaic was laid by the same masters who made the floor of the Beit Alfa synagogue. One of the inscriptions was written in Samaritan script.\n\nQ: What does the mosaic at Huldah contain?\n\nA: typical Jewish symbols\n\nTitle: Carnival\n\nBackground: Carnaval de Solsona takes place in Solsona, Lleida. It is one of the longest; free events in the streets, and nightly concerts run for more than a week. The Carnival is known for a legend that explains how a donkey was hung at the tower bell \u2212 because the animal wanted to eat grass that grew on the top of the tower. To celebrate this legend, locals hang a stuffed donkey at the tower that \"pisses\" above the excited crowd using a water pump. This event is the most important and takes place on Saturday night. For this reason, the inhabitants are called \"matarrucs\" (\"donkey killers\").\n\nQ: What does \"matarrucs\" mean?\n\nA: donkey killers\n\nTitle: Micrometre\n\nBackground: Micrometre The micrometre (International spelling as used by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures; SI symbol: \u03bcm) or micrometer (American spelling), also commonly known by the previous name micron, is an SI derived unit of length equaling (SI standard prefix \"micro-\" = 10); that is, one millionth of a metre (or one thousandth of a millimetre, 0.001 mm, or about 0.000039 inch).

General-purpose DBMSs aim to meet the needs of as many applications as possible, which adds to the complexity. However, the fact that their development cost can be spread over a large number of users means that they are often the most cost-effective approach. However, a general-purpose DBMS is not always the optimal solution: in some cases a general-purpose DBMS may introduce unnecessary overhead. Therefore, there are many examples of systems that use special-purpose databases. A common example is an email system that performs many of the functions of a general-purpose DBMS such as the insertion and deletion of messages composed of various items of data or associating messages with a particular email address; but these functions are limited to what is required to handle email and don't provide the user with all of the functionality that would be available using a general-purpose DBMS.\n\nQ: Name an example of a general-purpose DBMS.\n\nA: an email system\n\nTitle: Republic_of_the_Congo\n\nBackground: The economy is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts, an industrial sector based largely on petroleum, support services, and a government characterized by budget problems and overstaffing.

        "prompt": "Title: Paris\n\nBackground: Paris hosts one of the largest science museums in Europe, the Cit\u00e9 des Sciences et de l'Industrie at La Villette. The National Museum of Natural History, on the Left Bank, is famous for its dinosaur artefacts, mineral collections, and its Gallery of Evolution. The military history of France, from the Middle Ages to World War II, is vividly presented by displays at the Mus\u00e9e de l'Arm\u00e9e at Les Invalides, near the tomb of Napoleon. In addition to the national museums, run by the French Ministry of Culture, the City of Paris operates 14 museums, including the Carnavalet Museum on the history of Paris; Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris; Palais de Tokyo; the House of Victor Hugo and House of Balzac, and the Catacombs of Paris. There are also notable private museums; The Contemporary Art museum of the Louis Vuitton Foundation, designed by architect Frank Gehry, opened in October 2014 in the Bois de Boulogne.\n\nQ: What famous landmark is Mysee de l'Armee lat Les Invalides located ner?\n\nA: the tomb of Napoleon\n\nTitle: Cyprus\n\nBackground: In modern times Cypriot art history begins with the painter Vassilis Vryonides (1883\u20131958) who studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Venice. Arguably the two founding fathers of modern Cypriot art were Adamantios Diamantis (1900\u20131994) who studied at London's Royal College of Art and Christopheros Savva (1924\u20131968) who also studied in London, at Saint Martin's School of Art. In many ways these two artists set the template for subsequent Cypriot art and both their artistic styles and the patterns of their education remain influential to this day. In particular the majority of Cypriot artists still train in England while others train at art schools in Greece and local art institutions such as the Cyprus College of Art, University of Nicosia and the Frederick Institute of Technology.\n\nQ: Where did Vassilis Vryonides study?\n\nA: Academy of Fine Arts in Venice\n\nTitle: Ecuadorian hermit crab\n\nBackground: few months, but species such as \"Coenobita clypeatus\" have a 23-year lifespan if properly treated and some have lived longer than 32 years. Similarly Ecuadorian hermit crabs have been known to live to over 30 years. In general, and despite their moniker, hermit crabs are social animals that do best in groups. They also require a temperature and humidity-controlled environment (ideally approximately 80% humidity or above and 75-85F), and adequate substrate to allow them to bury themselves while molting.

Her second film Dreamgirls, the film version of the 1981 Broadway musical loosely based on The Supremes, received acclaim from critics and grossed $154 million internationally. In it, she starred opposite Jennifer Hudson, Jamie Foxx, and Eddie Murphy playing a pop singer based on Diana Ross. To promote the film, Beyonc\u00e9 released \"Listen\" as the lead single from the soundtrack album. In April 2007, Beyonc\u00e9 embarked on The Beyonc\u00e9 Experience, her first worldwide concert tour, visiting 97 venues and grossed over $24 million.[note 1] Beyonc\u00e9 conducted pre-concert food donation drives during six major stops in conjunction with her pastor at St. John's and America's Second Harvest.

The gene's DNA is used as a template to generate a complementary mRNA. The mRNA matches the sequence of the gene's DNA coding strand because it is synthesised as the complement of the template strand. Transcription is performed by an enzyme called an RNA polymerase, which reads the template strand in the 3' to 5' direction and synthesizes the RNA from 5' to 3'. To initiate transcription, the polymerase first recognizes and binds a promoter region of the gene. Thus, a major mechanism of gene regulation is the blocking or sequestering the promoter region, either by tight binding by repressor molecules that physically block the polymerase, or by organizing the DNA so that the promoter region is not accessible.:7\n\nQ: How does the nucleotide sequence of mRNA compare to DNA?\n\nA: complementary to the DNA from which it was transcribed\n\nTitle: Australia\n\nBackground: Rim nations, while maintaining close ties with Australia's traditional allies and trading partners.

Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat.

        "prompt": "Title: Gymnastics\n\nBackground: In the past, the floor exercise event was executed on the bare floor or mats such as wrestling mats. Today, the floor event occurs on a carpeted 12m \u00d7 12m square, usually consisting of hard foam over a layer of plywood, which is supported by springs or foam blocks generally called a \"spring\" floor. This provides a firm surface that provides extra bounce or spring when compressed, allowing gymnasts to achieve greater height and a softer landing after the composed skill. Gymnasts perform a choreographed routine up to 90 seconds in the floor exercise event; Depending on the level, they may choose their own, or, if known as a \"compulsory gymnast,\" default music must be played. In some gymnastic associations such as United States Association of Gymnastic Clubs (USAIGC), gymnasts are allowed to have vocals in their music but at USA Gymnastics competitions a large deduction is taken from the score for having vocals in the music. The routine should consist of tumbling lines, series of jumps, leaps, dance elements, acrobatic skills, and turns, or piviots, on one foot. A gymnast can perform up to four tumbling lines that usually includes at least one flight element without hand support. Each level of gymnastics requires the athlete to perform a different number of tumbling passes. In level 7 in the United States, a gymnast is required to do 2\u20133, and in levels 8\u201310, at least 3\u20134 tumbling passes are required.\n\nQ: What is the floor exercise events performed on now?\n\nA: a carpeted 12m \u00d7 12m square, usually consisting of hard foam over a layer of plywood\n\nTitle: Southampton\n\nBackground: The annual Southampton Boat Show is held in September each year, with over 600 exhibitors present.

Foothills are also found in southeastern Chenango, southern Montgomery, northern Otsego, and western Schenectady counties. At the eastern end of the range, the mountains begin quite dramatically with the Catskill Escarpment rising up suddenly from the Hudson Valley.

Washington University obtained Tyson as surplus property from the federal government in 1963. It is used by the University as a biological field station and research/education center. In 2010 the Living Learning Center was named one of the first two buildings accredited nationwide as a \"living building\" under the Living Building Challenge, opened to serve as a biological research station and classroom for summer students.\n\nQ: What is the function of Tyson Research Center?\n\nA: a biological field station and research/education center.\n\nTitle: Treaty\n\nBackground: No one party to a treaty can impose its particular interpretation of the treaty upon the other parties.

Consent by all parties to the treaty to a particular interpretation has the legal effect of adding another clause to the treaty \u2013 this is commonly called an 'authentic interpretation'.\n\nQ: What may be implied of other parties fail to explicitly disavow a party's initially unilateral interpretation of a treaty?\n\nA: Consent\n\nTitle: Charles Babbage\n\nBackground: Charles Babbage Charles Babbage (; 26 December 1791 \u2013 18 October 1871) was an English polymath. A mathematician, philosopher, inventor and mechanical engineer, Babbage originated the concept of a digital programmable computer. Considered by some to be a \"father of the computer\", Babbage is credited with inventing the first mechanical computer that eventually led to more complex electronic designs, though all the essential ideas of modern computers are to be found in Babbage's analytical engine. His varied work in other fields has led him to be described as \"pre-eminent\" among the many polymaths of his century.

        "prompt": "Title: Bacteria\n\nBackground: As with bacterial classification, identification of bacteria is increasingly using molecular methods. Diagnostics using DNA-based tools, such as polymerase chain reaction, are increasingly popular due to their specificity and speed, compared to culture-based methods. These methods also allow the detection and identification of \"viable but nonculturable\" cells that are metabolically active but non-dividing. However, even using these improved methods, the total number of bacterial species is not known and cannot even be estimated with any certainty. Following present classification, there are a little less than 9,300 known species of prokaryotes, which includes bacteria and archaea; but attempts to estimate the true number of bacterial diversity have ranged from 107 to 109 total species \u2013 and even these diverse estimates may be off by many orders of magnitude.\n\nQ: What tool does DNA based diagnostics use?\n\nA: polymerase chain reaction\n\nTitle: Comics\n\nBackground: While comics are often the work of a single creator, the labour of making them is frequently divided between a number of specialists. There may be separate writers and artists, and artists may specialize in parts of the artwork such as characters or backgrounds, as is common in Japan. Particularly in American superhero comic books, the art may be divided between a penciller, who lays out the artwork in pencil; an inker, who finishes the artwork in ink; a colourist; and a letterer, who adds the captions and speech balloons.\n\nQ: What does an inker do?\n\nA: finishes the artwork in ink\n\nTitle: Francis Drake\n\nBackground: the English Nation\" of 1589) along the Chilean coast. In the Magellan Strait Francis and his men engaged in skirmish with local indigenous people, becoming the first Europeans to kill indigenous peoples in southern Patagonia. During the stay in the strait, crew members discovered that an infusion made of the bark of \"Drimys winteri\" could be used as remedy against scurvy. Captain Wynter ordered the collection of great amounts of bark \u2013 hence the scientific name.

The Shagari government became viewed as corrupt and incompetent by virtually all sectors of Nigerian society. The military coup of Muhammadu Buhari shortly after the regime's fraudulent re-election in 1984 was generally viewed as a positive development. Buhari promised major reforms, but his government fared little better than its predecessor.

The ROK Army intelligence upon which Resolution 83 was based came from U.S. Intelligence; North Korea was not invited as a sitting temporary member of the UN, which violated UN Charter Article 32; and the Korean conflict was beyond the UN Charter's scope, because the initial north\u2013south border fighting was classed as a civil war. Because the Soviet Union was boycotting the Security Council at the time, legal scholars posited that deciding upon an action of this type required the unanimous vote of the five permanent members.\n\nQ: Where did the intelligence information that led to the passage of Resolution 83 come from?\n\nA: U.S. Intelligence\n\nTitle: Galileo (horse)\n\nBackground: Galileo (horse) Galileo (foaled 30 March 1998) is a retired Irish Thoroughbred racehorse and active sire.

        "prompt": "Title: Glass\n\nBackground: The observation that old windows are sometimes found to be thicker at the bottom than at the top is often offered as supporting evidence for the view that glass flows over a timescale of centuries, the assumption being that the glass has exhibited the liquid property of flowing from one shape to another. This assumption is incorrect, as once solidified, glass stops flowing. The reason for the observation is that in the past, when panes of glass were commonly made by glassblowers, the technique used was to spin molten glass so as to create a round, mostly flat and even plate (the crown glass process, described above). This plate was then cut to fit a window. The pieces were not absolutely flat; the edges of the disk became a different thickness as the glass spun. When installed in a window frame, the glass would be placed with the thicker side down both for the sake of stability and to prevent water accumulating in the lead cames at the bottom of the window. Occasionally such glass has been found installed with the thicker side at the top, left or right.\n\nQ: Who used to make window panes?\n\nA: glassblowers\n\nTitle: FA_Cup\n\nBackground: The first six rounds are the Qualifying Competition, from which 32 teams progress to the first round of the Competition Proper, meeting the first of the 92 professional teams. The last entrants are the Premier League and Championship clubs, into the draw for the Third Round Proper. In the modern era, non-league teams have never reached the quarter finals, and teams below Level 2 have never reached the final.[note 1] As a result, as well as who wins, significant focus is given to those \"minnows\" (smaller teams) who progress furthest, especially if they achieve an unlikely \"giant-killing\" victory.\n\nQ: Has a level 2 club reached the finals ever?\n\nA: Level 2 have never reached the final.\n\nTitle: 2017 Cleveland Indians season\n\nBackground: Cubs for the second longest winning streak in Major League Baseball history. Their win streak reached 22 games on September 14, giving the Indians the longest winning streak in Major League Baseball since the 1916 New York Giants who own the all-time record with 26 straight without a loss. On September 15, the 22-game win streak ended in a 4\u20133 loss to the Kansas City Royals. The Indians finished the season with a record of 102\u201360, the best record in the American League.

It educated workers to approach shopping as an exciting social activity not just a routine exercise in obtaining necessities, just as the bourgeoisie did at the famous department stores in the central city. Like the bourgeois stores, it helped transform consumption from a business transaction into a direct relationship between consumer and sought-after goods.

General: Natural gas Natural gas is a naturally occurring hydrocarbon gas mixture consisting primarily of methane, but commonly including varying amounts of other higher alkanes, and sometimes a small percentage of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, hydrogen sulfide, or helium. It is formed when layers of decomposing plant and animal matter are exposed to intense heat and pressure under the surface of the Earth over millions of years. The energy that the plants originally obtained from the sun is stored in the form of chemical bonds in the gas.\n\nQ: ['what is natural gas composed of?']\n\nA:",

According to his principle of the social contract, Locke said that the government lacked authority in the realm of individual conscience, as this was something rational people could not cede to the government for it or others to control. For Locke, this created a natural right in the liberty of conscience, which he said must therefore remain protected from any government authority.\n\nQ: In what year was John Locke born?\n\nA: 1632\n\nTitle: Association_football\n\nBackground: Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the Laws of the Game.

Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw.

Her mother was extremely protective, and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called \"Kensington System\", an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller, Sir John Conroy, who was rumoured to be the Duchess's lover. The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable (including most of her father's family), and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them. The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William's bastard children, and perhaps prompted the emergence of Victorian morality by insisting that her daughter avoid any appearance of sexual impropriety. Victoria shared a bedroom with her mother every night, studied with private tutors to a regular timetable, and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her King Charles spaniel, Dash. Her lessons included French, German, Italian, and Latin, but she spoke only English at home.\n\nQ: Who was Victorias mothers comptroller?\n\nA: Sir John Conroy\n\nTitle: Antenna_(radio)\n\nBackground: One example of omnidirectional antennas is the very common vertical antenna or whip antenna consisting of a metal rod (often, but not always, a quarter of a wavelength long). A dipole antenna is similar but consists of two such conductors extending in opposite directions, with a total length that is often, but not always, a half of a wavelength long. Dipoles are typically oriented horizontally in which case they are weakly directional: signals are reasonably well radiated toward or received from all directions with the exception of the direction along the conductor itself; this region is called the antenna blind cone or null.\n\nQ: What type of antenna would most likely be a half a wavelength long?\n\nA: dipole\n\nTitle: Phi Beta Kappa\n\nBackground: stands for (\"\"), which means \"Love of wisdom is the guide of life\" or \"Philosophy is the governor of one's life.\" According to Phi Beta Kappa, the organization has chapters in about 10% of American higher learning institutions, and about 10% of these schools' Arts and Sciences graduates are invited to join the society.

While some islanders were voluntary recruits the \"blackbirders\" were notorious for enticing islanders on to ships with tricks, such as pretending to be Christian missionaries, as well as kidnapping islanders at gun point.

        "prompt": "Title: Asphalt\n\nBackground: The Albanian bitumen extraction has a long history and was practiced in an organized way by the Romans. After centuries of silence, the first mentions of Albanian bitumen appeared only in 1868, when the Frenchman Coquand published the first geological description of the deposits of Albanian bitumen. In 1875, the exploitation rights were granted to the Ottoman government and in 1912, they were transferred to the Italian company Simsa. Since 1945, the mine was exploited by the Albanian government and from 2001 to date, the management passed to a French company, which organized the mining process for the manufacture of the natural bitumen on an industrial scale.\n\nQ: When were the Ottoman rights given to the Simsa company?\n\nA: 1912\n\nTitle: Railway_electrification_system\n\nBackground: Besides increased efficiency of power plants, there was an increase in efficiency (between 1950 and 1973) of the railway utilization of this electricity with energy-intensity dropping from 218 to 124 kwh/10,000 gross tonne-km (of both passenger and freight trains) or a 43% drop. Since energy-intensity is the inverse of energy-efficiency it drops as efficiency goes up. But most of this 43% decrease in energy-intensity also benefited diesel traction. The conversion of wheel bearings from plain to roller, increase of train weight, converting single track lines to double track (or partially double track), and the elimination of obsolete 2-axle freight cars increased the energy-efficiency of all types of traction: electric, diesel, and steam. However, there remained a 12\u201315% reduction of energy-intensity that only benefited electric traction (and not diesel). This was due to improvements in locomotives, more widespread use of regenerative braking (which in 1989 recycled 2.65% of the electric energy used for traction,) remote control of substations, better handling of the locomotive by the locomotive crew, and improvements in automation. Thus the overall efficiency of electric traction as compared to diesel more than doubled between 1950 and the mid-1970s in the Soviet Union. But after 1974 (thru 1980) there was no improvement in energy-intensity (wh/tonne-km) in part due to increasing speeds of passenger and freight trains.\n\nQ: What type of locomotives got improved during 1950-1973 in Soviet Union?\n\nA: electric\n\nTitle: Amitriptyline\n\nBackground: for migraine prevention, also in cases of neuropathic pain disorders, fibromyalgia and nocturnal enuresis. Amitriptyline is a popular off-label treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), although it is most frequently reserved for severe cases of abdominal pain in patients with IBS because it needs to be taken regularly to work and has a generally poor tolerability profile, although a firm evidence base supports its efficacy in this indication. Amitriptyline can also be used as an anticholinergic drug in the treatment of early-stage Parkinson's disease if depression also needs to be treated. Amitriptyline is the most widely researched agent for prevention\n\nQ: ['what is amitriptyline?']\n\nA:",

Mexico protested, and Roosevelt decided to circumvent the decision and make sure the federal government treated Hispanics as white. The State Department, the Census Bureau, the Labor Department, and other government agencies therefore made sure to uniformly classify people of Mexican descent as white.

In many instances, mixed racial ancestry is so far back in an individual's family history (for instance, before the Civil War or earlier), that it does not affect more recent ethnic and cultural identification.\n\nQ: What is race sometimes seen as?\n\nA: a social construct\n\nTitle: Chicago Cubs\n\nBackground: have spent time broadcasting from the Cubs booth since the death of Harry Caray in 1998.

        "prompt": "Title: LaserDisc\n\nBackground: In March 1984, Pioneer introduced the first consumer player with a solid-state laser, the LD-700. It was also the first LD player to load from the front and not the top. One year earlier Hitachi introduced an expensive industrial player with a laser diode, but the player, which had poor picture quality due to an inadequate dropout compensator, was made only in limited quantities. After Pioneer released the LD-700, gas lasers were no longer used in consumer players, despite their advantages, although Philips continued to use gas lasers in their industrial units until 1985.\n\nQ: Besides a solid-state laser, what else was unique about the LD-700?\n\nA: first LD player to load from the front and not the top\n\nTitle: Kanye_West\n\nBackground: On March 30, 2015, it was announced that West is a co-owner, with various other music artists, in the music streaming service Tidal. The service specialises in lossless audio and high definition music videos. Jay Z acquired the parent company of Tidal, Aspiro, in the first quarter of 2015. Including Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z, sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Rihanna, Beyonc\u00e9, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake. The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry, and to rival other streaming services such as Spotify, which have been criticised for their low payout of royalties. \"The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again, to recognize its value\", stated Jay-Z on the release of Tidal.\n\nQ: What music service is a huge competitor for Tidal?\n\nA: Spotify\n\nTitle: Aborigines (mythology)\n\nBackground: suggested are \"arborigines\", meaning \"tree-born,\" and \"aberrigines\", meaning \"nomads\". Lycophron calls a people of central Italy, \"Boreigonoi\". The Aborigines were believed to have been descendants of the Pelasgians, the mythical ancestors of all Greek peoples. Their earliest known home was Reate, an ancient Sabine town to the north-east of Latium near Carseoli. These Aborigines were driven from their mountain home by the Sabines and settled on the river Anio. The Sicels, who inhabited Latium at the time, gave way to the Aborigines, and a portion of them emigrated to Sicily, providing the origin for the island's name.
